This is the page on TCIAS for my little book "Building a Web App Guided By Tests". The purpose of this book is
to guide you through building a simple weather app using tests and continuously deploying to a Heroku instance.

As you read through the chapters you will learn:

 * how to create write functional tests with cucumber.js, selenium and webdriver.js
 * how to write unit and integration tests using karma and jasmine
 * run continuous unit and integration tests using Codeship
 * deploy to a Heroku instance

To read the book you can try either of the links below. The
[Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.io/book/gregstewart/modern-web-app-development/) link allows you to both read the book
online, as well as download formats for your devices and e-readers. The [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/building-a-web-app-guided-by-tests)
link only provides download options. Why two? Well [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.io/) provides an awesome interface
  to read the book online, whereas at this stage I prefer [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/)'s e-reader formats.
