A whole new game starts - the dungeon finder is made available and the tanking journey starts.

<a href="http://tank-n-spank.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ScreenShot_090210_215655.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7" title="ScreenShot_090210_215655" src="http://tank-n-spank.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ScreenShot_090210_215655.jpeg" alt="" width="1280" height="800" /></a>

<a href="http://tank-n-spank.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ScreenShot_090210_215655.jpeg"></a>So I hit 15 last night and straight away queued for a dungeon. It was quite a surprise to be tanking again, for one I was missing the complete arsenal of abilities a lvl 80 warrior has at his disposal: <a title="Shield Slam" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=23925">Shield Slam</a>, <a title="Schockwave" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=46968">Shockwave</a>, <a title="Sword and board" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=46953">Sword and Board</a>, <a title="Devastate" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=47498">Devastate</a> and <a title="Warbringer" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=57499">Warbringer</a> (in no particular order) and the lack of rage was quite a schock. I found myself limited to just basically applying stacks of <a title="Sunder Armor" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=7386">sunders</a> and if it was a larger group of mobs, pray that I had enough time on them to build enough rage for a <a title="Thunder Clap" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=47502">Thunder Clap</a>.

None of it is really a concern, since instancing is easy and most people know how to get out of trouble, but it's funny as a tank I always feel responsible if a mob runs off, even if the DPS was targeting the wrong target or started hitting it before you even got near. At this level <a title="Taunt" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=355">taunt</a> is your friend! <a title="Sunder Armor" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=7386">Sunder Armor</a> a close second and then rage permitting, well take your pick of <a title="Thunder Clap" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=47502">TC</a> or <a title="Revenge" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=57823">Revenge</a> or <a title="Heroic Strike" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=47450">Heroic Strike</a>.

Oh and do yourself a favour, grab a shield and go into defensive stance! Your healer will thank you. :)
