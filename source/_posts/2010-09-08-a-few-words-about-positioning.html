When you run in or charge, make sure no mob is hitting you from behind, or else be prepared for stuns and crits. Once you have a little bit of threat on the mobs, start positioning the mobs so that they have their backs to your group (remember melee, but in particular Rogues, like doing it from behind!) and you are facing your group (if anyone pulls aggro, you have clear line of sight of the mob running off to take a bite out of their intended target).

I also like to stand with my back to a wall, if at all possible - good habit to get into for all those encounters where the boss/creature has an annoying knock back skill.

A picture speaks a thousand words right? ;)

Be aware that a lot of folks will start unloading on the mobs as soon you as have charged in (regardless of level or difficulty). You might not have actually hit any of the targets yet, but that all too often doesn't concern some of your group members. Take a deep breath and be prepared to taunt the mob back (and take pleasure in the fact that your random dungeon queue last seconds and theirs starts at 15 minutes ;)). In a future post I'll share a macro to help with targets, well at least for group members that have an iota of common sense.
