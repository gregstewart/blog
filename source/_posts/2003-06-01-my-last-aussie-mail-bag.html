<p>This is going to be my last entry before embarking on my return trip to the mothership. This time I read up on PHP, trust, navigation, text based advertising, testing , acronyms, accessibility and to wrap it up a little Cold Fusion and Flash.</p>
<ol>
	<li>First off the <a href="http://www.webreference.com/programming/php/cookbook/"
>PHP cookbook</a>. Web reference has chapter 11 of this book up on it's site and this chapter looks at URL Get methods and provides sample code for dealing with these types of requests. </li>
	<li>An <a href="http://www.semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000011.php">interesting article on engendering trust</a> in an on-line environment.</li>
	<li>At Adaptive Path you can find a set of links relating to Navigation. In <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000048.php">the first article</a>, the focus is determining the language of navigation (read terminology), so that everybody sings from the same hymn sheet, understands their function and thus can easily identify the components discussed. <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000103.php">The second article</a> focuses it's discussion on managing navigation, i.e. keeping the depth to just three levels and discusses what can form part of the persistent site wide navigation and what should fall into content areas.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.webreference.com/internet/enterprise/">Web refrerence has an article</a> in similar vein to the metadata one published in the web reference newsletter a few days back</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030428.html">Text-only advertisements work far better than banners, but is this only due to their novelty? Search engine text ads will retain their superiority over time, but text ads on other sites will work only if they focus on directly meeting users' needs.</a>". This article by Jakob Nielsen looks into Plain text banner ads.</li>
	<li>Hot on the trot of the Nielsen Alert box: <a href="http://www.clickz.com/search/strat/article.php/2196411">Google AdWorks: Best Practices</a>. A introduction into how it works and how to make the most of it.</li>
	<li>Bewildered by all those on-line acronyms?? Go to <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/">Webopedia</a> to find out there meaning.</li>
	<li>Some time ago I started using CSS for print based media. Out of curiosity I read up on it again and stumbled across <a href"http://www.webreference.com/js/column95/">this article on the web reference site</a>. It's a few years old, but certaily a worth while read, especially if you need to support those non web standards compliant browsers.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/xplatform/">Via Zeldman.com I came across this article on cross platform testing</a> on A List Apart from last year. It looks into setting up a testing environment on a mac for cross browser/platform testing and also has links to a few other sites on the topic.</li>
	<li>Hat tip to Zeldman again for this one. <a hef="http://skillswap.brightonnewmedia.org/">A UK based site dedicated to web dev skill swapping</a>. It also has a pretty good presentation on accessibility the pros and cons and how ot go about it, very good and long (79 slides)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030428.html">Another Alert Box from Jakob Nielsen on clear text ads</a> and why they are currently working so well and would appear to do so for the forseeable future.</li>
	<li>Boxes and arrows is carrying an article <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/archives/building_a_metadatabased_website.php">on building a meta data based web site</a>. This has some really cool information and includes a fictious case study.</li>
	<li>Another superb collection of IA information, this time <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/archives/002572.php">relating to automating Visio</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/flash/articles/ria_databases.html" title="Bicycle Parts Catalog: Macromedia Flash and Databases">Bicycle Parts Catalog: Macromedia Flash and Databases</a> provides a step by step guide to building a flash front end catalogue that gets it's content from a database.</li>
	<li>I have started playing round with <acronym title="Cold Fusion MX">CFMX</acronym> in earnest now and have been using the built in web server. <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/coldfusion/adv_development/config_builtin_webserver/" title="Configuring the Macromedia ColdFusion MX built-in web server">Here is the config information I found.</a></li>
