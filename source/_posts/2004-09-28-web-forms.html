Dan Cederholm has published another <a href="http://www.devarticles.com/c/a/Web-Design-Standards/Web-Forms/" title="Web Forms ">great overview</a> of how to build accessible forms. He takes a form built using the "traditional" method, i.e. tables, and during the course of the article shows you how to re-create it using guidelines set out by web standards (interestingly he opted for definition lists, whereas I have only ever thought of using divs and spans). To cap it off he applies some neat little <acronym title="Cascading StyleSheets">css</acronym> to enhance the look and feel.
