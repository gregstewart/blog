<p>Below are three useful load testing tools that were mentioned in a Mach-ii thread. I was only aware of one so far: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/archive/itsolutions/intranet/downloads/webstres.mspx" title="Download MS Web Application Stress Tool">MS Web Application Stress Tool</a>. Today I was made aware of two other options:</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/" title="Apache JMeter">Apache JMeter</a>, a java based desktop application that can not only load test your web applications, but also databases, ftp servers and java objects.</li>
	<li><a href="http://opensta.org/" title="OpenSTA">OpenSTA</a> an open source load testing solution, which runs on Win32 clients.</li>
</ol>
