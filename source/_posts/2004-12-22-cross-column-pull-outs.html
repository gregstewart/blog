Pretty cryptic sounding title but this ALA article shows <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/crosscolumn/" title="Cross-Column Pull-Outs">how to create column layout</a>, that will wrap around say an image (something the print world heavily relies on). Pretty neat, though they are some issues, i.e. it does not work on a Mac (IE 5.2) and the technique requires additional markup elements that could put off developers who believe in semantic markup.
<h4>Plus</h4>
The folks over at Couloir <a href="http://www.couloir.org/js_slideshow/" title="Couloir.org: Resizing, Fading Slideshow Demo">have done it again</a>. Not satified with developing a fading image solution using JavaScript, they have released another JavaScript slide show with re-sizes based on the image's width and height. And the photos are amazing...
