I have just updated the <a href="/?p=243" title="JRun resources">jrun resources</a> page to include <a href="http://www.robisen.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=FD4BE2FC-55DC-F2B1-FED0717CC1C7E0AF" title="Hung Servers, Java.lang.OutOFMemory errors and Tuning CF JVM">this article by Robi Sen</a>, which discusses ways to overcome  Java.lang.OutOfMemory and Jrun Connection closed messages. In his experience many these messages/erros are down to the Scheduler Service being improperly configured in the jrun.xml file. He also briefly covers tuning the JVM with some good explanations.
<h4>Update</h4>
I have added a new section to the JRun resources page relating to JVM tuning as I realised that I had forgotten (thanks to the above article) to put up a few other links on that topic.
