<p>Got round to applying <a href="http://whatdoiknow.org/archives/001629.shtml" title="Flash slide show source">Todd Dominey&#8217;s Flash Slide Show</a> to display some of the photos I have taken over the last fours years. Using the technique mentioned on <a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/archives/flash_sells_web_standards.php" title="Flash Sells! (Web Standards?)">asterisk *</a>. Yep it&#8217;s quite unobtrusive and besides I was getting bored of the one image.</p>
