<p>After making the header change I decided to re-validate my pages, and shock horror they were valid. No fault of the code embedding the Flash, but rather my sloppy blogging technique.</p>
<p>I built the CMS that drives this site 2 years ago  and built it purely with flexibility in mind. Truth be told I think it served it&#8217;s purpose well in this capacity. Times have moved on and faced with content that doesn&#8217;t validate (even if the template framework is valid), I have decided to re-build &amp;amp; (that&#8217;s the CMS).</p>
<p>So as my first step in re-vamping the CMS I thought I&#8217;d put out version 1 for nought. Yep you can download it, install it, use it, do whatever you like with version 1. I am hoping that some of you may find it useful and maybe you can provide me with some feedback or even suggestions as to where version 2 should head.</p>
<p>For a full list of what 1.0 can do, have <a href="http://www.tcias.co.uk/v2/products/amp/" title="">a look at this page</a></p>
<p>For version 2 here are a few things that I intend to add/enhance:</p>
<ul>
	<li>generate/store xHTML valid content (and deal with all those special characters)</li>
	<li>add a spell checker (probably Jazzy)</li>
	<li>preview content</li>
	<li>improved content management</li>
	<li>revamp the entire interface using CSS and xHTML (a first taster is the nice logo designed by <a href="http://www.aphyx.com/" title="www.aphyx.com">Martin Cleave</a>)</li>
	<li>build it using ColdFusion (<a href="http://www.newatlanta.com/products/bluedragon/index.cfm" title="Blue Dragon">New Atlanta&#8217;s version</a>, though it should be fully compatible with <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/coldfusion/" title="Macromedia ColdFusion MX 6.1">CFMX</a>)</li>
	<li>base it on the <a href="http://www.mach-ii.com/" title="mach-ii.com">Mach-ii</a> Framework</li>
	<li>better install scripts and documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>I am sure the lost will grow, but these so far have been the goals I have set myself for this project. In the meantime, hope you like version 1. <a href="http://gregs.teacupinastorm.com/downloads/amp_1.0.zip" title="Download the source">Grab the source here</a>! Do note that it doesn&#8217;t contain much in the way of documentation and only possess rudimentary install scripts. Drop me a line if you need any help.</p>
