Version 0.1 is available <a title="Get Stubbie" href="http://stubbie.riaforge.org/index.cfm?event=action.download">for download</a>. I'd like to call this the "I am working release, but it's all a little messy" release. There are a ton of improvements to be made and still a few features I'd like to add, but it's working and figured this was a good time to put the code out there and get some feedback.
