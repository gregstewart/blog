<p><a href="http://www.pjk.us/paul/blog/" title="Best Served Cold">Paul Kenney</a> released few days back his equivalent to JUnit for ColdFusion Components: <a href="http://www.cfcunit.org/" title="&lt;cfcUnit/&gt;">&lt;cfcUnit/&gt;</a>. It requires cfmx 6.1 and the Mach-II framework. The documentation is not complete yet, however the install instructions are up. Be sure to check back!!</p>
<p>Paul has also kindly put up an excerpt from Christian's Cantrell's article &#8220;<a href="http://www.cfcunit.org/docs/intro/whatIsUnitTesting.html" title="What is Unit Testing?">What is Unit Testing?</a>&#8221;, which was initially published on the Macromedia DRK 3. The full article was called: "CFUnit Testing Components".</p>
