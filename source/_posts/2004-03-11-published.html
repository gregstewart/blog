<img src="/html/i/cfdj200403s.png" width="163" height="209" alt="ColdFusion Developer Journal - March 2004" class="floatleft" /><p><a href="http://www.sys-con.com/magazine/?issueid=369&src=false" title="Volume: 6 Issue: 3">This months CFDJ</a> carries an article that I wrote, I know it's a shameless plug, but it really doesn't happen often. It's all about <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/story/?storyid=43994&DE=1" title="Using JRun Instances for CFMX Deployment">my experiences with JRun and CFMX instances</a> using Apache or IIS as the web server. Benjamin Blackwell also contributed an article about JRun in this issue entitled <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/story/?storyid=43997" title="Confronting JRun - Who's Afraid of J2EE?">Confronting JRun - Who's Afraid of J2EE?</a>, which takes a good look at what's going on under the hood of JRun!</p>
<p>Since writing that article I have also made a few additional posts here, which I have listed for convenience and completeness below:</p>
