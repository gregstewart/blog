Finally got round to implementing this for work. As a starting point I followed <a title="Apache Based Server" href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-serversetup-apache.html#tsvn-serversetup-apache-5">the instructions found here</a>.

The config looked fine, but after restarting the service, I still wasn't getting prompted for a log in. After re-jigging the order to what you see below and restarting the apache service (we are using 2.0.59), it all worked. Maybe this will help someone else along the way.

[code]
<Location /svn>
DAV svn
# any "/svn/foo" URL will map to a repository /usr/local/svn/foo
SVNParentPath {drive letter}:/path/to/SVN/epositories/

AuthName "SVN"
AuthType SSPI
SSPIAuth On
SSPIAuthoritative On
SSPIOfferBasic On
SSPIOmitDomain on
SSPIDomain &lt;domain controller&gt;
SSPIBasicPreferred On
Require valid-user
</Location>
[/code]
