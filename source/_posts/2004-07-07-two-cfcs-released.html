<p>I have just completed putting together two <acronym title="ColdFusion Components">CFCs</acronym> that I hope will help reduce some of my UI coding time. The first is a <a href="/downloads/form.zip" title="get form CFC">form CFC</a> and <a href="http://www.tcias.co.uk/projects/form/index.cfm" title="see formCFC in action">you can see a small demo of it here</a>. It allows you to build up form elements and their labels programmatically, while taking away the chore of making sure you specify all the attributes that make it web standards compliant form (it validates as xHTML 1.0 transitional) and also ensuring that it adheres to accessibility guidelines. Furthermore you can pass in dynamic values, queries (for drop downs), enable and disable fields. Have a look at <em>index.cfm</em> to see how I used it for the example (or explore the component using the component browser).</p>
<p>The second is a <a href="/downloads/table.zip" title="get table CFC">table CFC</a> (<a href="http://www.tcias.co.uk/projects/table/index.cfm" title="table CFC in action">demo here</a>). Like the form CFC it aims to take the chore out of creating tables, remembering all the right attributes (this one too validates as xHTML 1.0 transitional) and adhering the accessibility guidelines. Yep , no more excuses now (at least not while it comes to tables and forms). Feedback, suggestions, problems, etc, are welcomed!!</p>
