<p>More tweaks to the look and feel of the site. I used a background pattern from <a href="http://www.squidfingers.com/patterns/" title="squidfingers/patterns">Squidfingers</a> for the backdrop and finally ditched the white background colour. I used a PNG with opacity, so if you are using IE you won't benefit from the transparency effect of the background.</p>
