Here a few ways to remove those pesky windows carriage return characters from your scripts that you run into when migrating from a windows environment to a *nix. From the command line to recursively carry out this task you can type:

<code>[code]find -type f <your> | xargs dos2unix[/code]</your></code>

Where dos2unix is the utility that actually carries out the conversion. If you are using vi to edit a file then you can achieve this conversion as well by escaping and typing the following (note the square brackets and their contents represent keyboard strokes):

<code>[code]:%s/[ctrl+v][return]//g[return][/code]</code>

This is a regexp type command that tells vi to select the entire file (%) and search (s/) for carriage returns ([ctrl+v][return]) and do a global replace (/g) with non windows return code ([return]).
