Garrett has published <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php" title="Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications">a little essay</a> over at Adaptive Path discussing a new approach to building be applications: Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript + XML). By his own admission this is not such an entirely new approach as anybody who has been using Gmail can attest too. It's nice to see that it has gone mainstream now and is getting more attention.

So for those keen on a little more information (courtesy of <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/archives/000689.html" title="Scrubbing Innovation into Interaction: Ajax">Jeff Veen's blog</a>):
