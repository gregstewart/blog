			<p>Here the creative meets technology. Implementing the carefully crafted design into a dynamic database driven web site is our speciality.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="content_item">
			<h4>Technology</h4>
			<p>We are comfortable developing solutions using PHP, ColdFusion, Java/JSP and .NET at the application level. The databases that drive our applications have been MySQL/Oracle and Microsoft SQL server. At the interface level we develop solely using xHTML and CSS.</p>
			<p>Whatever your preferred platform we can accommodate your requirements thanks to our exposure to a plethora of platforms running on both Unix and Windows, served by IIS, Apache or Tomcat.</p>

			<div class="content_item">
			<h4>Web standards</h4>
			<p>What if we told you that we could deliver solutions that are leaner, faster loading, cross platform compatible and easier to maintain?? When it comes to the interface, web standards deliver massive gains. Leaner code delivers smaller pages, which in turn download faster and save on bandwidth. Separating content from presentation means easier maintenance and cross platform/device compatibility.</p>
			<p>These are the promises of web standards based design and implementation, but don?t take our word for it, see the business cases put forward by others: <a href="http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2003/why-web-standards/" title="The business of Web Standards">The business of Web Standards</a>, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/seo/" title="Using xHTML/CSS for an effective SEO campaign">Using xHTML/CSS for an effective SEO campaign</a> and <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000266.php" title="The business value of web standards">The business value of web standards</a>.</p>
