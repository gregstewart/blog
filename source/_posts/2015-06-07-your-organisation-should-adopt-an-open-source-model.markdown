Open Source has changed the way we plan, build software and consume software. And I am not just referring the `free as in beer` aspect. When you add tools and services like Github and Travis into the mix Open Source reached a new level. And you and your organistion should embrace the same model.

Put aside the obvious benefits of using OS in your products and look at what the OS model can bring to your development practices.

At Red Badger we love Github, not just because it is a great Git interface, but because it allows us to collaborate easily and effectively. ___Social coding___

### Individuals

Just think of how many people use and contribute to your favourite OS project. The collective power of this community that is using, reviewing and providing feedback makes the project successful and resilient.

Now think of your code and project, imagine having folks provising you with that feedback, suggestions and feature ideas? Would you not grow as a developer? Would your code not be better? Would your project not benefit?

### Teams

Many of the things, that are true for the individual are true for the team. The added benefit is the greater level of collaboration and communication within the team and potentially other teams in your organisation as well, since they now to have visibility of your work.

### Products
Products are better designed, more secure


### Companies
Profile raised. Easier to hire new developers
