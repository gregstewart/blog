If I reflect on how things have changed over the last 15 years, and I look at where we are now as developers I believe we are in a golden age. Actually it feels like a succession of golden ages. When I first started doing development, it was a very solitary activity, the internet had only just hit mainstream, you got your knowledge from books, the search engine of choice was Alta Vista, Open Source software was somethign that lived on SourceForge, was incredibly difficult to get a hold off, build and run. You were really out of luck if you were running Windows, trying to install Linux was not for the feint of heart, scrap that, you had to almost be down right masochistic to give it a go. Open Source was equated to `free as in beer` by most and that was awesome in it's own right, if you could get it to work.

Fast forward 15 years and Open Source has changed the way we plan, build, collaborate and consume software. The two things that have propelled this are [Git] and [Github](https://github.com/). With it's wide spread adoption Open Source reached a new level, where we developers, product owners, companies can benefit, indeed have benefitted so much from. 

Not because it is easier to find packages/tools/software and use them. No, because it made collaborating on projects so easy. While I have been using Github for a number of years, I don't think I quite grasped it's true power. The flow was nicer than TFS and Bitbucket that's what I would have told you. At [Red Badger](http://wwww.red-badger.com/) we love Github, not just because it is a great Git interface, it allows us to collaborate easily and effectively. In the last 4 months, I have worked with it everyday, committing, opening Pull Requests, discussing/reviewing and ultimately improving the code and my capability as a developer. 

The other thing it has brough us is transparency. I used to read through documentation and then try and get things working, if I got stuck, well I would search a little bit, if unsuccessful I would give up and move on. Now though? I look at the repo, look at the code, usually starting with tests, the hidden documentation, the first client for your code. The answer usually lies at the intersection of the two. How needs demos/examples... Well actually demos are still a good thing `:)` Open Source and Github has made this so accessible.

While I wanted to focus on Open Source and the model in this post, I realise I have spoken more about Github, but to be truly effective in adopting such a model, you can't really do it without using Github. Just switching to Git will not have the same impact. Yes, __you and your organisation should embrace the same model__. 

Put aside the obvious benefits of using Open Source in your products and look at what the Open Source model combined with GitHub can bring to your development practices, team(s) and product(s).

### Individuals

Just think of how many people use and contribute to your favourite OS project. The collective power of this community that is using, reviewing and providing feedback makes the project successful and resilient.

Now think of your code and project, imagine having folks provising you with that feedback, suggestions and feature ideas? Would you not grow as a developer? Would your code not be better? Would your project not benefit?

### Teams

Many of the things, that are true for the individual are true for the team. The added benefit is the greater level of collaboration and communication within the team and potentially other teams in your organisation as well, since they now to have visibility of your work.

### Products
Products are better designed, more secure


### Companies
Profile raised. Easier to hire new developers
