I am in the market for a new Digital camera and I do quite like the idea of getting DLSR of some sorts. The current favourite it the <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos300d/" title="Canon EOS 300D / Digital Rebel / Kiss Digital Review">Canon eos 300d</a>. Mainly because of the guys around the office have been saying so, but also because a few comments on Slashdot and the firmware hacks that are out there. However there is so much new information to absorb and I was quite pleased to stumble across this series of articles: <a href="http://www.thetechlounge.com/article.php?directory=beyond_megapixels_part_1" title="Beyond Megapixels">Beyond Megapixels</a>, which had some useful information as to what to look out for. Again well worth a read.
