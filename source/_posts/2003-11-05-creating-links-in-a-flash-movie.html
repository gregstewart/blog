<p>Something real basic but since I never did it before, here is how you mimic the <strong>&lt;a href=""&gt;</strong> behaviour of a hyperlink in a Flash movie using a little bit of ActionScript:</p>

<p>When I do Flash work I tend to place most of ActionScript code in Layer 1 Frame 1. And in this place I set a variable called link, which will hold the URL I want to point to, like such:</p>

<p><em>link = "http://gregs.teacupinastorm.com/";<br />
stop();</em></p>

<p>Next I create a button and make it a symbol and assign an action to this symbol:</p>

<p><em>on (release) {<br />
	getURL(link, "_blank");<br />
}</em></p>

<p>The value for link is passed through when the movie starts up and as soon as you click on the button surface you?ll be taken through to the URL.</p>
