So here we are a quarter of the way into 2015 already, the sun is out, the weather is getting warmer in London.

[In January](http://www.tcias.co.uk/blog/2015/01/08/new-years-resolution/), I spellt out some goals I wanted to adopt for 2015 and four months into the year seems like a good moment to take stock of things. 

The first thing I wanted to achieve was to write one blog post a week, so far I have posted 15 (including this one) and we are up to 16 weeks into the year - only 1 post behind! That's actually not too bad. I haven't chalked up as many analytical posts as I wanted to, but I am pleased to have gotten into the habit of writing one post a week.

On the book front - I had set myself a goal of reading one book a month. To date I have finished three, so once again a little behind the set expectation:

 * [Release it](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1069827.Release_It_)
 * [Essential Skills for the Agile Developer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9850098-essential-skills-for-the-agile-developer)
 * [Scope and Closures (You Don't Know JS)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20901022-scope-and-closures)
 
 I am in the process of reading:
 
 * [This & Object Prototypes (You Don't Know JS)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22221108-you-don-t-know-js)
 * [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7912517-seven-languages-in-seven-weeks)
 * [The Doodle Revolution: Unlock the Power to Think Differently](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17707707-the-doodle-revolution)
 * [Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4268826-growing-object-oriented-software-guided-by-tests)
 
My own book writing though has languished... I am not even sure I want to into the whys and whats and I probably should to get the ball rolling again. Let's add that one to the _TODO_ list.

On the side project front, I surprised myself a little and released [a gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/coder_wally) - which has been downloaded 2557 times to date. I suspect the majority are mine `;)` That was en interesting experiment and I blogged about it quite a bit.

I also left [Skype](https://www.skype.com/) after 2 years and releasing the [Skype for Web](https://web.skype.com/) experience (which actually had it's first and to that point only release back in November). I now work for [Red Badger](http://red-badger.com/) as a [Technical Architect](http://www.linkedin.com/in/gregstewart) and I am having a lot of fun again. A upcoming blog post will describe how we are building and continously shipping an isomorphic app using [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [Arch](https://github.com/redbadger/arch) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) using [Circle CI](circleci.com). I cannot emphasies enough, how much changing your tooling and being able to use the best in breed tools can mean to your personal (__/developer__) happiness, productivity and enthusiasm.
