I stumbled across <a href="http://security.linux.com/security/05/03/23/2239205.shtml?tid=35" title="Tips for when hackers strike">this interesting post</a> on how a system administrator investigated and secured one of his compromised servers. He talks you through his investigative process, methods for cleaning up the compromised server and points to plenty of resources and tools for locking down your server.
