<h3>Adding to the "Send to" command</h3>
<p class="1">One way to quickly open files is to use the send to command that you usually find by right clicking on a file. This is extremely usueful when you are developing and you quickly want to look at the content of a file. Now the only problem that exists is that most file types are not listed in there. So what you now need to do is to add the progam you wish to send the files to. In the following I will show you how to do this.</p>
<p class="1">The first thing you need to do is locate the <b>Send To</b> folder. This can be found in your Profiles directory, e.g.: <i>c:winntprofiles&lt;your username&gt;Send To</i>. Once you have located that folder you will need to add a shortcut to the application you wich to send files to. So in this example we are going to add the Notepad application to the <b>Send To</b> folder.</p>
<p class="1">Right click on the folder space and select <b>New/Shortcut</b>. Then all you need to do is locate the Notepad.exe file, which is located in the <i>c:winnt</i> and follow the prompts.</p>
<p class="1">There you go all done, quickly check by right clicking and looking at the options available to you under Send To!</p>
