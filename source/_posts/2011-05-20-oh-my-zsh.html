Stumbled across a <a href="http://thechangelog.com/post/5452652236/hooray-oh-my-zsh-has-been-updated">post</a> onÂ <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh" target="_blank">Oh My Zsh</a> this morning and on a pure whim decided to give it a whirl. After 8 hours or so of use, I am really, really liking it. It's the small things.

The git integration shown in the above screenshot is just is the icing on the cake, seriously worth spending some time on this if you spend any length of time at the Terminal.
