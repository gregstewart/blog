Today is my last day at <a href="http://www.hometrack.co.uk/">Hometrack</a>. What started as a short term contract, turned into one of those rare great work experiences that lasted 6 years and spanned 2 hemispheres. Last days are always a bit peculiar, a little nostalgic, and there are a bunch of people I will miss interacting with on a day to day basis. Looking forward though, there's a month off and many new and exciting challenges ahead.

It also marks the end of my affiliation with ColdFusion, but not the Adobe toolset. Starting in July, I am moving full time into the UX field, as a Senior UI developer/consultant for <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> and I am truly excited at the Â prospect of joining them and working with a bunch of extremely smart, dedicated and passionate people.

As a final note to this post, my good friend Zac put together a little clip of my commits to one of the projects we worked on together, which I wanted to share, as it uses a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gource/">neat version control visualisation tool</a>:

As the saying goes: "So long, and thanks for all the fish"
