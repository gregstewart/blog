<p>Another helpful person on the <abbr title="ColdFusion Developer Journal">CFDJ</abbr> mailing list posted <a href="http://www.cfdev.com/mx/undocumentation/" title="The ColdFusion MX Un-Documentation">this link</a>, which is a neat site that lists some of the undocumented functions in <abbr title="ColdFusion MX">CFMX</abbr> and also shows how they found out about them [yep, by taking advantage of the Java/<abbr title="ColdFusion MX">CFMX</abbr> integration].</p>
