<p>Stumbled across <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/" title="Regular-Expressions.info">Regular-Expressions.info</a>, which claims to be &quot;The Premier Web Site about Regular Expressions&quot; and I certainly found one or two handy hints to help me fix a few bugs with my blog.</p>
<p>And while I am on the topic someone posted this site on the CFCDev list today: <a href="http://regexlib.com/" title="Regular Expression Library">Regular Expression Library</a>, which has some 638 expressions from contributors, is fully searchable and it even has a little test application for checking your <abbr title="Regular Expression">RegExp</abbr> against JavaScript and ASP.</p>
