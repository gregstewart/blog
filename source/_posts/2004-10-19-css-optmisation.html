A couple of articles on optimising your CSS, try <a href="http://www.orderedlist.com/articles/writing_lean_css" title="Writing Lean CSS">writing lean CSS</a> or use <a href="http://home.no.net/junjun/html/shorthand.html" title="Introduction to CSS shorthand properties">short hand</a> techniques. One small thing to be aware off as a comment indicates is to be careful with shorthand as some browsers are known to have a few problems displaying style declarations that use shorthand [the second article gives examples of those techniques and lists browser compatibility]. A good approach to take as a result of this is to start without optmisation techniques and then once you are done, optimise!
