A client recently decided to start storing all of their images in a database and usually we would point the image source to a cfm page, where we'd do something like this:

[code]

request.uploadedPic = application.staffManager.getStaffImage(session.user.getId());
context = getPageContext();
context.setFlushOutput(false);
response = context.getResponse().getResponse();
out = response.getOutputStream();
response.setContentType("image/jpeg");
response.setContentLength(arrayLen(request.uploadedPic['staffPhoto'][1]));
out.write(request.uploadedPic['staffPhoto'][1]);
out.flush();
response.reset();
out.close();

[/code]

Which worked nicely until I read about some <a title="CFDocument performance" href="http://www.webapper.net/index.cfm/2007/2/18/CFDocument-performance">performance issues</a> with http calls and the cfdocument tag. Zac (yes his name pops up a lot in this blog), put me onto directly embedding the image into the source, like such:

[code]<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,&lt;cfoutput&gt;#BinaryEncode(request.uploadedPic['staffPhoto'][1],'Base64')#&lt;/cfoutput&gt;" alt="Embedded Image" />[/code]

No need to make a http call to display the image anymore.
