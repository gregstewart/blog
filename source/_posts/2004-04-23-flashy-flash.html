<p>Something to play around with. Over at <a href="http://www.7nights.com" title="asterisk * | D. Keith Robinson's Web Design Blog.">asterisk *</a>, there is an example of standards compliant mark-up for Flash (not sure if it's backward compatible with older browsers, but that's by the by at this point), which I was thinking of combining with <a href="http://whatdoiknow.org/archives/001629.shtml" title="Flash slide show source">Todd Dominey's Flash Slide Show</a> [you know the one he used on the <a href="http://www.pga.com/pgachampionship/2003/" title="The 85th PGA Championship">PGA 2003 site</a>] for my little header. Below, for future reference, is the code that validates the Flash embedding as xHTML 1.1 strict.</p>
<p><em>&lt;object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" data="c.swf?path=intro.swf" width="600" height="200"&gt;<br />
 &lt;param name="movie" value="c.swf?path=intro.swf" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/object&gt;</em></p>
