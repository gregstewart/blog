I was just reading through this mornings <a href="http://www.sdtimes.com">SD times</a> newsletter and there was an interesting link to a new (-ish, it was released in May) search engine called <a href="http://koders.com/" title="Source Code Search Engine">Koders</a>, which returns results from open source projects. It even has a little <a href="http://koders.com/info.aspx?c=tools" title="Tools and downloads">Mozilla and Eclipse search plugin</a>. Now there is even less of a reason to re-invent the wheel.
