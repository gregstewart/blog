Here's a superb way to securely transfer files between two hosts. If you have SSH up and running on two hosts you can use the following command to carry out the transfer.

[code]$ scp &lt;filename&gt; user@remoteHost:/path/to/copy/file/to[/code]

Once you hit return you'll be prompted to provide your password so that you can login and start the transfer.

I have also updated <a href="/linux/de-compressing_files_in_linux.php" title="de-compressing files in linux">de-compressing files in linux</a> demonstrating, how to Gunzip and un-tar in one step.
