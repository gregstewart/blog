I have been reading <a href="http://www.pepysdiary.com/" title="The Diary of Samuel Pepys">Pepy's diaries</a> (on and off admittedly and between bouts of reading Stephenson's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0434008176/teacupinastor-21" title="Read Quicksilver">Baroque</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099410699/teacupinastor-21" title="Read the Confusion">Cycle</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0434011770/teacupinastor-21" title="read The System of the World">trilogy</a>) since I stumbled across it one bored afternoon at work in Sydney for nearly two years now and today I happened to be looking at <a href="http://www,sparklytrainers.com/blog/" title="Sparkly Trainers | The travels of Mary Loosemore">friend's blog</a> (who now works with me in London), following a few links to other sites and to my absolute surprise it turns out that the man behind Pepy's diaries is none other than her <a href="http://www.gyford.com/" title="Phil Gyford">boyfriend</a>. The world is such a small place sometimes.
