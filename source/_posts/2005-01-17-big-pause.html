There'll be a long pause for the next month or so. By the time you read this I'll be sat in plane on my way to Oz for a whirlwind tour taking in Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Melbourne, Wollongong and Perth, a couple of weddings and catching up with friends and family whom I haven't seen for two years now. Needless to say I am very excited!
