Here's another one that has taken me a while to figure out. I had mod_rewrite working perfectly on this Linux box, but somehow never got it to work properly on Win32. To start off open up your httpd.conf file and un-comment:

[code]LoadModule rewrite_module modules/mod_rewrite.so[/code]

Then locate the following segment:

[code]#
# Each directory to which Apache has access can be configured with respect
# to which services and features are allowed and/or disabled in that
# directory (and its subdirectories).
#
# First, we configure the "default" to be a very restrictive set of
# features.
#
<directory>
Options FollowSymLinks
AllowOverride None
</directory>[/code]

After much tinkering and experimenting I stumbled across the following settings, which after saving and re-starting Apache results in mod_rewrite picking up the rules you set up in your .htaccess file.

[code]<directory>
Options All
AllowOverride FileInfo
</directory>[/code]
