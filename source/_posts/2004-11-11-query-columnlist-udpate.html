A while back I blogged about query.columnList and how in CFMX the list is returned ordered alphabetically, which was a slight nuisance at the time. Just recently someone posted an SQL statement that fixed this problem (beware it is vendor dependant):

[code]SELECT t.column_name FROM all_tab_columns t WHERE t.table_name='TABLE_NAME'[/code]
