We finally got <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=41378">Maloriak</a> down last night, yay for us. I found this encounter quite challenging, mainly because I was on add duty and rounding those buggers up can be a tad annoying. As you can see in the video, selecting them took me a while sometimes and luckily it was never after a <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=92970">Scorching Blast</a> or the healers would have been toast. And there's a tip, they always go for the healers, so stand close to them when they spawn and it'll save you heaps of running round (this only really works if they don't pop during <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=92970">Scorching Blast</a> - if they do, time for some running round).

We had the help of team 1 alts (which always goes a long way so big thanks to them). Our initial tactic was to wait for 9 aberrations to be released before AOE-ing them down. While the first round never was a problem, come the second round, I'd invariably die as soon the next 9 were all on me. T1 suggested we go for 12/6 and boom we got him down. When you have 12 adds up it really helps if you have a mage in your group to cast <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=82691">Ring of Frost</a> and if you have a DK, use <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=49203">Hungering Cold</a> as well.
