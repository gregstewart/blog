In this document I will show you two methods of configuring e-mail forwarding on a Linux mail server. You will need to have superuser access rights or login as root. Secondly you will need to know how to use the Vi editor (see <a href="http://gregs.teacupinastorm.com/html/article/article.php?id=881FE5AB-0398-4FF2-B9800809DAADB3F0">Basic Vi editing</a> for an introduction). Also in the examples don't type the information in brackets, unless othewise specified, as it's only their for comment purposes.So let's get cracking.

<strong>Using .forward</strong>

In the first method we will create a file in the users home directory. So change to the user's directory (in our example it will be jsmith [Or our trusty John Smith user]). There you will have to create a file called <em>.forward</em> using vi. In the file you will enter the e-mail address where all the messages are to be forwarded to. Follow the example below and substitute jsmith for your user's name.

<em>cd /home/jsmith

vi .forward

(enter the e-mail address to which all incomming messages are to be forwarded)

jsmith@otherdomain.com

(save and quit the file)</em>

You have now configured all of John Smith's e-mails to be sent to jsmith@anotherdomain.com

<strong>Using the aliases file</strong>

The second method is to use the aliases file. So just open the file in your Vi editor and create a new category at the end of the file called forwarding. There you will enter the username and point to the new address. The example below should help clarify this:

<em>vi /etc/aliases

(scroll to the end of the file and insert the following statements)

# Forwarding

jsmith:	jsmith@anotherdomain.com

(save and quit the aliases file and enter the following command)

sendmail -bi</em>

This method allows for better centralised control, as all the information is stored in one place and therefore easier to maintain. Again I hope you found this tidbit of information useful.
