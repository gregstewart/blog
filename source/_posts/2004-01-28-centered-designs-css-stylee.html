<p>This is a real short one. A while back I got inpired about Doug Bowman's work for a client (Adative Path) where he was using CSS to control layouts, determening from within the style sheet whether or not to have 1, 2 or three columns to display content. This alone blew me away, as it does work so well. I added the following stylesheet definition to one of our sites to add a simple centered layout:</p>

<p><em>#content {<br />
margin: 0 auto 0 auto;<br />
}</em></p>

<p>I lifted this little bit of CSS from <a href="http://www.studiotwin.com/" title="studio twin">this site</a>.</p>
<p>I should also point out the #content is a div that encompasses the previously mentioned three columns.</p>

<p>Update: Well I noticed that this doesn't work with IE 5.5, but as usual there is a work around.</p>
<p><em>body {<br />
	background: #fff;<br />
	text-align: center;/* centre it for IE5.5 */<br />
	voice-family: "\"}\""; /* Now re-adjust for Mozilla and IE6 since we don't want all of our text centred*/<br />
  	voice-family:inherit;<br />
	text-align: left;<br />
}</em></p>
