Today my server ran out of disk space. :( With the help of my friend Ed I was able to pin point the exact location. If you run this command from the root of your server:

[code]du -sh *[/code]

You will get something like the following:

[code]5.1M	bin
4.0K	boot
8.0K	dev
5.3M	etc
795M	home
11M	lib
0	lib64
16K	lost+found
4.0K	media
4.0K	mnt
4.0K	opt
0	proc
26M	root
3.8M	sbin
4.0K	selinux
4.0K	srv
0	sys
0	tmp
1.3G	usr
2.4G	var[/code]

Then you can start drilling down the folders until you find the exact culprit. In my case a log file had grown to 8 Gig in size.
