Just a quick note to let folks know that I have created a small project on <a href="http://www.riaforge.org/">RIA Forge</a> called <a href="http://stubbie.riaforge.org/">Stubbie</a>. Inspired by a feature in Rails, Stubbie basically creates a set of test stubs for your apps CFCs. I have set up specific blog for it over at RIA forge to keep everything in one place, but will post updates here as well.

Also there's no code yet, still one or two things I need to sort out before I'll make the first 0.1 release.
I'd just like to thank a few people who helped get this project of the ground:

Special thanks must go to Stephen (Spike) Milligan for allowing me to use his CFCDoc code which allowed me to quickly build the project without having to worry about the File System and CFC parsing.

Seth Petry-Johnson also deserves a special mention for allowing me to use his VarScopeChecker.cfc as part of the project so that we can all benefit from a var scope unit test.
