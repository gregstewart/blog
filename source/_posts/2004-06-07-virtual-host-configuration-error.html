<p>I was faced with an issue in getting a second site up and running using virtual hosts, and this was down to a mistake in my httpd.conf file. If you encounter the following error in your log files:</p>

<p><em>[Thu May 27 12:44:54 2004] [warn] _default_ VirtualHost overlap on port 80, the first has precedence</em></p>

<p>You can resolve it by un commenting the following line in your httpd.conf line:</p>
<p><em>NameVirtualHost *</em></p>

<p>And then setting host directive to: <virtualHost *>, instead of specifying a server name. Courtesy of: <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/vhosts/name-based.html" title="Name-based Virtual Host Support">Name-based Virtual Host Support</a>.</p>
