Two things that I needed to add to my on-going play with my DataGrids, one was to hide a column and the other was to set the width. Hiding isn't so much hiding the column more like removing it. The method for doing this is: removeColumnAt() and the argument passed in is the column number. In the example below I remove the first one (numbering starts with 0).

[as]// Responder function for result
function myRemotingFunciton_Result (result_rs) {
  dg_myDataGridName.removeColumnAt(0) // hide the ID
  dg_myDataGridName.setDataProvider(result_rs);
}[/as]

The other type (setting the width) involves editing a file that I refered to in <a href="http://gregs.teacupinastorm.com/flash/datagrid_headers.php" title="Datagrid headers">a previous post</a>. So if you had the followig code for styling a column in your dataGrid:

[as]import mx.controls.gridclasses.DataGridColumn;
yourDataGridInstanceName.columnNames = ["contactName", "companyName", "contactPhone", "summary"];
//customize column headers
var contactCol:DataGridColumn = yourDataGridInstanceName.getColumnAt(0);
contactCol.headerText = "Contact";[/as]

You'd simply add this to set the width to 120 and then simply save your file:

[as]contactCol.width = 120;[/as]
