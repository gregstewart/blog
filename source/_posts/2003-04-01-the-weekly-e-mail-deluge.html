<p>This week in my inbox:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The first thing I'd like to highlight is <a href="http://www.websiteoptimization.com/services/analyze/" title="web site optimisation tools">this new nifty tool</a>. Though not perfect this little application analyses the performance of your code. Love it!!! I ran the latest proof of concept for a client of ours through the analyser and it came up trumps (see CSS and xHTML really does work:))</li>
  <li>Not so much an item in my inbox as something I found while trying to solve a problem for the aforementioned proof of concept. Instructions and code on how to <a href="http://www.webweaver.org/dan/css/corners/with_borders.html" title="CSS rounded corners">create a rounded corner effect for boxes using images and CSS</a></li>
  <li>And an interview with the person behind the <a href="http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2003/espn-interview/01/" title="An Interview With Mike Davidson of ESPN (Part 1)">ESPN standards compliant re-design</a>. Part two out this Friday (28/3).</li>
  <li><a href="http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2003/why-web-standards/" title="Why web standards">Need to make a business case for CSS and xHTML</a>, Netscape Dev Edge has an article, that should give you an idea of how to present it.
Here are my highlights:
  <ul>
    <li>less is more, reduced page weight, saves bandwidth, and hence loads faster</li>
    <li>forward compatible, support the devices of tomorrow</li>
    <li>by separating design from content and mark up, it's easier to maintain a site wide consistency and make changes to these if needed</li>
    <li>accessibility, in many countries for government agencies (US, UK, Canada), and --in some countries like Australia-- for every organization, it is mandatory for sites to be accessible. Coding with standards makes it easier to achieve this</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Related to the above article is <a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/07/WebAgency-Requirements" title="Web agency requirements">another one</a> on the <a hrer="http://www.w3.org/" title="W3C">w3c site</a>, which again helps state the business case for standards, this time from a development perspective</li>
  <li>I thought I had put <a href="http://www.jjg.net/ia/visvocab/" title="Visio vocabulary">this link up</a>, but somehow it must have slipped through. Some info on IA and stencils for Visio (amongst others), their meaning, etc... Very useful. He also has put up this <a href="http://www.jjg.net/ia/visvocab/garrett_ia_cheatsheet.pdf" title="Garret's IA cheat sheet">handy cheat sheet</a>, with a brief explanation of all of the shapes.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.browsercam.com/default.aspx" title="Browser Cam">BrowserCam</a>, this is another web developers dream tool. Bypasses the need for an extensive and expensive testing environment, simply sign up (there is a free trial) and then test your web design/development against a multitude of browsers running on different OS flavours. And the pricing seems pretty reasonable as well.</li>
