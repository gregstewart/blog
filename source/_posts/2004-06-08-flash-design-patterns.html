<p>Colin Mook has put <a href="http://moock.org/webdesign/lectures/as2patterns/" title="DESIGN PATTERNS IN ACTIONSCRIPT 2.0">an interesting lecture/presentation</a> up which looks at design patterns from the Gang Of Four book as applied to Flash. He discusses the Obverser design pattern, as well as the <acronym title="Model View Controller">MVC</acronym> by providing explanations, usage scenarios along with example implementations.</p>
