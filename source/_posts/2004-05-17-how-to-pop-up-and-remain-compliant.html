<p>An interesting thread over at simplebits (http://www.simplebits.com/archives/2004/05/06/sq.html - SimpleQuiz ? Part XVI: Launching Windows) on luanching pop-ups and what path to take. It's an interesting discussion on attitudes towards standards and the methods devised to work with them. For many remaining with a strict doctype and using JavaScript was the way to go, but there were a number of good solutions. Here are two that I liked:</p>
