My dad wanted to have basic Authentication applied to his blog, so here are the directives you'd need to add to a Virtualhost configuration:

[code]
<virtualhost>
ServerAdmin info@somdomain.com
DocumentRoot /home/user/public_html
.....
<directory>
AuthType Basic
AuthName "By Invitation Only"
AuthUserFile {path to password file}/passwd/passwords
Require user yourUsername
</directory>
</virtualhost>
[/code]

In order for this to fully function you'll need to create a password file. The <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/howto/auth.html#basic" title="Basic authentication">instructions can be found here</a>. Of note if you are using Debian with the default Apache install (v. 1.3.x) is that htpasswd is located in <strong>/usr/bin</strong> and since it's a non standard install chances are you'll need to specify a different location for your password file than the one indicated in the above link. Since I have BD running I had created a whole bunch of directories and symbolic links to make BD believe that Apache was installed as per normal, so I just had to create a <strong>passwd</strong> folder in <strong>/usr/local/apache</strong>, but you may have to do more.
