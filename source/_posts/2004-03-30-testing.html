<p>On my list of things to do this month is to come up with a set of testing guidelines. Bearing that in mind I came across Anti-clue's website, who provided the following list of types and levels of testing (the original can be found <a href="http://www.anticlue.net/archives/000194.htm" title="Anticlue: Types of Testing">here</a>). A good starting point to make sure I don't forget anything!!</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Concept Testing:</strong> Testing to see if the concept of the application is viable.</li>
<li><strong>Functional Testing:</strong> Testing if the function that was changed/enhanced works as expected.</li>
<li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Testing to see if the program still functions as anticipated based upon scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Data Migration Testing:</strong> If you are switching to a new system, this is a test to ensure the data from the old system migrates properly to the new system.</li>
<li><strong>Integrated Testing:</strong> Testing to see if the application still functions as anticipated with other applications also based upon scenarios.</li>
<li><strong>Stress Testing:</strong> Testing to ascertain the load an application can withstand.</li>
<li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Testing to ensure that with the existing software, the newly added component doesn't have a negative impact. Normally scenarios are a good idea here.</li>
<li><strong>Interoperability Testing:</strong> Two systems are being tested for the data passed between the systems. Again scenarios are ideal.</li>
<li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> How users interact with the application. Is it cumbersome or does it flow?</li>
<li><strong>User acceptance Testing:</strong> The overall process satisfaction by the project sponsor and customers.</li>
</ul>
