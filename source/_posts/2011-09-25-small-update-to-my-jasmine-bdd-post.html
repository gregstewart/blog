Following on from my post way back in July, I have created a <a href="https://github.com/gregstewart/node-blog" title="Node-blog github repository">repository</a> over at the github, with some updated examples surrounding validation, adding comments to posts and some refactoring. 

I am currently looking into DI for javascript objects, as well as <a href="http://www.phantomjs.org/" title="PhantomJS: Headless WebKit with JavaScript API">phantom.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/velesin/jasmine-jquery" title="Jasmine-jquery github repository">jasmine-jquery</a> to start putting together some examples for user journey testing and easier testing of jquery widgets and fixture loading.
