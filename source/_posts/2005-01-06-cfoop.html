New Year, first post and a new category added to this site

Well 2005 certainly has started with a bang in terms of CFOOP if the first few posts of the year are anything to go by. ColdFusion Object Oriented programming is on the rise and rightfully so and I am pleased to see the endorsements coming from so many good people. This has been blogged about before but for the sake of my sieve like memory here are the links again to a couple of excellent posts:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.mattwoodward.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=43C9FCF7-5070-3118-2D88DB4327650927" title="What's an object">What's an object</a> is Matt Woodward's gentle but thorough introduction to an object as it relates to CF (all the while also giving you knowledge of what an object is in OOP terms in a wider context)</li>
	<li>Joe's post "<a href="http://clearsoftware.net/client/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=4492E3A9-E081-2BAC-6969DBF6739A5A92" title="CFCs, Cohesion, and Where I've Gone Wrong">CFCs, Cohesion, and Where I've Gone Wrong</a>" takes a look at developing objects, common mistakes made when setting out on the OOP path and what he did to fix these.</li>
</ul>

Both authors deserve praise for two excellent posts.
Incidentally anyone know what has happened to <a href="http://www.cfoop.com/">cfoop.com</a>?
