Ever wanted to know how you can style the browse button of a file upload field?? Well strictly speaking you can't but as with most things <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/inputfile.html" title="Styling an input type='file'">there are ways around it</a>, however it will only work with browsers that support Opacity and JavaScript will have to be enabled. Hat tip goes to <a href="http://www.shayna.com/blog" title="CF_Pretty Accessible Blog">Sandy Clark</a> for finding this work around.
