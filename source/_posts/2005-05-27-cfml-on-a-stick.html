In the last couple of posts I made passing references to using a USB Flash drive for development. My dad just got back from a trip to the US and brought me back a little present: <a href="http://www.transcendusa.com/products/ModDetail.asp?ModNo=45" title="Transcend - JetFlash 2A">a 1 Gig usb drive</a>. It is absolutely awesome, as soon as I got home I loaded Eclipse onto it and fired it up and it just worked (no surprises there as quite a few others had already achieved that feat). Next I put my current development files on there and I just pointed Eclipse to the new work space and after a restart - mobile development here we come!!

Then I wanted to see how far I could take this: so I downloaded <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html" title="XAMPP">XAMPP</a> (XAMPP is based on the popular LAMP [Linux, Apache, Mysql and PHP] and includes a bunch of other tools) and extracted the contents of the package to my USB drive. Switching to the command prompt I navigated to XAMPP folder and started Apache using the included apache_start.bat file, opened a browser and went to http://localhost/ and there you go Apache and PHP working of the USB key (note: make sure you don't have any other Apache instances running).

But could I get CFMX or BlueDragon to run off of this configuration as well?

First off I selected <a href="http://www.caucho.com/index.xtp" title="Caucho Technology - Resin... faster">Resin</a> as my application server and proceeded to set up resin to talk to Apache. I ran the setup.exe file and specified the path to my Apache folder, i.e. E:\xampp\apache and restarted Apache. But that failed, for some reason resin assumed that I was running apache-1.3.x so I edited Apache's httpd.conf file to this:

[code]LoadModule caucho_module "E:/resin-3.0.12/win32/apache-2.0/mod_caucho.dll"
#AddModule mod_caucho.c
...
<ifmodule>
ResinConfigServer localhost 6802
CauchoStatus yes
AddHandler caucho-request jsp
</ifmodule>[/code]

Once done I restarted Apache and it started up no problem. Now to test the connection between Apache and resin, simply locate resin.conf (in my case I found it at E:\resin-3.0.12\conf\) and right at the end you should see an entry like the following one:

[code]<!-- configures the default host, matching any host name -->
<host root-directory=".">
<!--
- configures an explicit root web-app matching the
- webapp's ROOT
-->
<web-app id="/" document-directory="webapps/ROOT">
</web-app></host>[/code]

Change it to this, which tells resin to use Apache's default document directory.

[code]<!-- configures the default host, matching any host name -->
<host root-directory=".">
<!--
- configures an explicit root web-app matching the
- webapp's ROOT
-->
<web-app id="/" document-directory="E:/xampp/htdocs">
</web-app></host>[/code]

All this information can be <a href="http://www.caucho.com/resin-3.0/install/cse-apache-win.xtp" title="Resin with Apache on Windows">found here</a>, including steps to test your set up by creating a test.jsp file. Then I started resin using (where "E" is the drive letter of my usb drive):

[code]E:\resin-3.0.12\httpd[/code]

And browsed as per the instructions to http://localhost/test.jsp and it worked just like that.

Since I was on a roll, I decided to try out  BlueDragon, so I downloaded the J2EE version and extracted the files and copied the BlueDragon62.war file to E:\resin-3.0.12\webapps and restarted resin so that BlueDragon could be deployed. A little bit of patience is required here as it starting the Application server can take a wee while (this becomes the norm regardless of whether BlueDragon has been deployed, obviously this is a limitation of running it off the USB stick). Here is that output from the server start up:

You know that everything is running once you see <strong>hmux listening to 127.0.0.1:6802</strong>. You can now test your deployment by browsing to: http://localhost/BlueDragon62/, which should display the BlueDragon CFML test page.
