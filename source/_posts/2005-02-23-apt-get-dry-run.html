One of the features I like most about Debian is the package manager (apt). It's simply awesome when it comes to managing package dependencies or just simply keeping your system up-to-date. A while back though I ran into trouble when using apt-get upgrade (to cut a long story short, not the package managers fault but mine), but it left me wishing that I could do a dry run of an upgrade to see what would be happening. And of course you can:

[code]
apt-get -s upgrade
[/code]

On hitting the return key the process of upgrading your packages proceeds as before, but without actually installing anything. Very neat.
