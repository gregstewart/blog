A big thank you to <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> for once again up-ing theÂ  resources for my hosting plan. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-mode_Linux">UML</a> instance now has 256Meg of Ram and 8 Gig of storage space as well as 100Gig transfer cap. Combine that with an awesome service and you have a winner. Thanks again Linode!
