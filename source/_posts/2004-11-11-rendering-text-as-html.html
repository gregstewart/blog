When populating text fields (Text tool/Dynamic text/instanceName) based on the results from a query you normally

[as]_root.instanceName.text = yourResult;[/as]

However one recent scenario asked for the field to be a mailto link and here's how you set the field in question to display as HTML rather than straight text.

[as]_root.instanceName.html = true;
_root.instanceName.htmlText = '<a href="mailto:%20%27+yourResult+%27">' + yourResult + '</a>';[/as]
