So apparently Apple has been a tad naughty and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/04/how-apple-tracks-your-location-without-your-consent-and-why-it-matters.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss">been tracking</a> where us iPhone and iPad 3G users roam. Two researchers <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/04/apple-location-tracking.html">have published these findings</a> along with <a href="http://petewarden.github.com/iPhoneTracker/">an app</a> that overlays the data on an OpenStreetMap map. So this is me:

I am disappointed that this is turned on by default, not so much for myself as I find the information interesting, but it's always best to ask first, right? I know plenty of people who are very sensitive about this type of information. And apparently I don't venture to far north of the river either.
