Well it's all change, again. Not moving or changing job this time, but I have been seconded onto a new project that's going to take me away from CFML and more into the Java/J2EE realm, which is exciting. This explains in part the relative silence over the last few weeks as I have been busy assimilating information about the new role and Oracle Portal. Hopefully normal service will resume again and you'll also be able to expect some insights into Oracle Application server
