<p>Molly Holzschlag has written an article <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.asp?p=170511" title="Strategies for Long-Term CSS Hack Management">outlining some strategies for managing CSS hacks</a>, i.e. when to use them and how to use them. It's very insightful as it for one explains some of the hack techniques in good detail (like the high pass filter one), but also outlines how you can exploit poor CSS implementations to accommodate the latest CSS features without disrupting those that have poor support at least until they catch up!</p>
