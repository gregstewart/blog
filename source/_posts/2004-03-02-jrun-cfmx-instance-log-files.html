<p>If you are running CF on top of JRun and have separate instances you may be wondering where the log files for these applications are now kept and here is where:<p>
<p><em>{install path}\servers\instanceName\cfusion-ear\cfusion-war\WEB-INF\cfusion\logs</em></p>
<p>The following path holds the logs files for JRun instances with their start up info, error/debug and event information<p>
<p><em>{install path}\logs</em></p>
