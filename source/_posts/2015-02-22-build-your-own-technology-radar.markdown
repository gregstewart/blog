This weeks [Ruby Rogues episode](http://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/195-rr-building-your-technology-radar-with-neal-ford) had Neal Ford on to talk about the [ThoughtWorks Technology Radar](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar). One of the things that Neal discussed was creating your own [Technology](http://nealford.com/memeagora/2013/05/28/build_your_own_technology_radar.html) [Radar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cqf1neieE4). 

I am always on the lookout for new ways of working, particularly to make my learning better. Neal recommends putting together such a radar to help focus how we learn by being more strategic, rather then tactical. That and it serves as reminder of the things we might want to look into `:)` (well for me at least).

So here's my first go at putting such a list together:

#Hold
* RequireJs (Tools)

#Assess
* Gulp (Tools)
* Scala (Languages and Frameworks)
* Swift (Languages and Frameworks)
* ReactJs (Languages and Frameworks)
* Living CSS Style Guides (Techniques)
* Gradle (Tools)
* Play Framework (Languages and Frameworks)
* SnapCI (Tools)
* ES6 Transpilers (Tools)

#Trial
* Browserify (Languages and Frameworks)
* Functional programming (Techniques)
* ES6 (Languages and Frameworks)
* Dashing (Languages and Frameworks)
* Phantomas (Tools)
* Build your own Technology Radar (Techniques)
* Docker (Tools)
* Programming by Intention (Techniques)
* AWS (Platforms)
* CircleCi (Tools)

#Adopt
* Grunt (Tools)
* Vagrant (Tools)
* Heroku (Platforms)
* Linode (Platforms)
* CodeShip (Tools)
* Git Pull Request Workflow (Techniques)

The next step is to experiment with [this visual tool](https://github.com/bdargan/techradar) for displaying your own Technology Radar.

Have you put your own Technology Radar together yet?
