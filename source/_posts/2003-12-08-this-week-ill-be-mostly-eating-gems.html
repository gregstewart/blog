<p>This week I have been mainly reading up on ColdFusion [frameworks, architecture, how-to&#39;s and what not&#39;s all to do with MX]... And a little CSS.</p>
<ol>
 <li>Sean Corfield, is the Director of Architecture at Macromedia and a one of the people behind Mach-ii, this is his <a href="http://www.corfield.org/blog/" title="An Architect's View">blog</a> and it some has some pretty useful insights into the CF developer world.</li>
 <li>Basically a <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/wtg/public/machiidevguide/index.html" title="Mach II Development Guide TOC">Macromedia document</a> explaining the development of applications using the Mach-II framework</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.mach-ii.com/" title="Mach-ii">FuseBox for MX</a>, this is the official home</li>
 <li>The <a href="http://www.corfield.org/index.php?fuseaction=machii.main" title="Mach-ii unofficial home">unofficial home</a> of Mach-II at Sean Corfield's site</li>
 <li>A nifty <a href="http://www.bpurcell.org/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=980" title="Configuring the third party MySQL database driver in ColdFusion MX">little guide</a> to configuring native MySQL JDBC drivers in CFMX [and <a href="http://www.bpurcell.org/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=981" title="Configuring the Microsoft SQL Server 2000 JDBC database driver in ColdFusion MX">more JDBC info</a>]. His site also has a wealth of additional information on CFMX, great stuff...</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.bpurcell.org/macromedia/coldfusion/multiple_instances.cfm" title="ColdFusion MX 6.1 Step-by-Step Creating and Configuring Multiple Instances">ColdFusion MX 6.1 Step-by-Step Creating and Configuring Multiple Instances</a> - as the title indicates how to install/configure CFMX to run multiple instances of a server on JRun, though this article appears to be only focused on using the built-in web server he does talk about using IIS when adding new sites.</li>
 <li>Purcell also pointed to <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/jpda/" title="JavaTM Platform Debugger Architecture">this source</a> for debugging cfmx apps. Check it out and <a href="http://www.bpurcell.org/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=969" title="Using the Java Remote Debugger Interface (JPDA) with ColdfusionMX or JRun">his set up info</a></li>

 <li>For those lucky enough to have the joy of working with Spectra, well Macromedia <a href="http://spectrasource.macromedia.com/active/" title="Spectra Open-source Release Announcement">released the source</a> a while back...</li>
 <li>I am definitely on the CF trail... Here is a <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/coldfusion/extreme/cftags_cfscript.html" title="Using ColdFusion tags in cfscript">little article</a> on how to create your own cftags to be used from within cfquery. Swell.</li>
 <li>Subscribe to a <a href="http://www.cfczone.org/listserv.cfm" title="welcome to the cfcdev listserv">CFC mailing list</a> covering topics on OO Methodologies and Design Patterns for CF</li>
 <li>Sean is rapidly becoming my favourite source of information for all things CF/Flash. <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/flashremoting/articles/facades.html" title="Software Design Patterns For Macromedia Flash Remoting">Here he discusses</a> design patterns in relation to Flash remoting.</li>
 <li>Mezzoblue provides <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/css/cribsheet/" title="CSS Crib Sheet">a handy list</a> of things to consider when developing CSS and it also contains the order for borders, think TRouBLed (Top, Right, Bottom, Left).</li>
 <li>An <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/blog/archives/000114.html" title="Margin Collapsing">interesting discussion</a> about collapsing margins in CSS</li>

Eric Meyer also <a href="http://www.complexspiral.com/publications/containing-floats/" title="Containing Floats">gives us more insight</a> into the float problem.</li>
 <li>Something I was going to write about, but someone beat me to it. All you need to know about building an <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/guides/htmladvanced/forms.php" title="Accessible Forms">accessible form...</a></li>
 <li>This <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/slashdot2/" title="Retooling Slashdot with Web Standards Part II">two part article</a> was interesting for a number of reasons. The main one being a showcase on how standards implemented sites could benefit companies in terns of savings. That's only one of the reasons I am jotting this one down, the other he has links to some mobile device emulators... Always come in handy these!</li>
 <li>ALA is carrying a second article this week, another look at <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/customcorners/" title="CSS Design: Creating Custom Corners & Borders">how to implement round corners</a>.</li>
