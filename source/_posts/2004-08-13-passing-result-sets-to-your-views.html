So you have managed to execute a query, but how on earth do you get them to be passed through the framework to your view. The trick is to set a <strong>resultKey</strong> for the result to be stored in, as shown below:

[code]<event-handler event="someEvent" access="public">
<notify listener="myListener" method="getMyQueryResults" resultKey="request.myResults" />
<view-page name="myView" />
</event-handler>[/code]

In your view you can then reference the result doing something like this:

[code]
<cfloop query="request.myResults">
<!--- loop over your result set --->
</cfloop>
[/code]
