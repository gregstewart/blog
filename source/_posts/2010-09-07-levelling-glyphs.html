At level 15, you get access to your first set of glyphs, one major (<a href="http://tank-n-spank.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/16px-Inv_glyph_majorwarrior.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-79" title="Warrior major glyph" src="http://tank-n-spank.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/16px-Inv_glyph_majorwarrior.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" /></a>) and one minor (<a href="http://tank-n-spank.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/16px-Inv_glyph_minorwarrior.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-80" title="Warrior minor glyph" src="http://tank-n-spank.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/16px-Inv_glyph_minorwarrior.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" /></a>). To help oiptimise your levelling experience and speed (just as food buffs, potions and enchants help) you should look at filling the newly opened up Glyph slots.

The information below has been taken from: <a title="WotLK Warrior Leveling (Talents, Glyphs, etc)  " href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17616372095&amp;sid=1">http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17616372095&amp;sid=1</a>

"<strong><a title="Glyph of Overpower" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=43422">Glyph of Overpower</a></strong><a title="Glyph of Overpower" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=43422"> <img title="Warrior major glyph" src="http://tank-n-spank.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/16px-Inv_glyph_majorwarrior.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" /></a> – This is an exceptional leveling ability. Getting parried kills your rage generation and is extremely annoying when facing defensive heavy mobs. This will also allow you to kill higher level mobs without too much trouble. Only higher than Sweeping Strikes because this is useful as soon as you get Overpower"

I wasn't convinced about this, mainly because of the prohibitive costs of the glyph on our server (I guess that should have been an indication), which was ~25 gold. As soon as I saw one for under 10 gold, I grabbed it and having used it for 2-3 levels, I am won over!

"<strong><a title="Glyph of Battle" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=43395">Glyph of Battle</a></strong><a title="Glyph of Battle" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=43395"> <img title="Warrior minor glyph" src="http://tank-n-spank.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/16px-Inv_glyph_minorwarrior.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" /> </a>– A 50% increase to your Battle Shout timer. Definitely worth it if you can find it for a decent price on the AH. Less time wasted by using a GCD on putting up a new shout."

No brainer here, especially if you are like me, and forget regularly to refresh it. You could argue that extending it by 4 minutes is worse, but it works for me while killing things. Others prefer going for :

"<strong><a title="Glyph of Bloodrage" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=43396">Glyph of Bloodrage</a></strong><a title="Glyph of Bloodrage" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=43396"> <img title="Warrior minor glyph" src="http://tank-n-spank.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/16px-Inv_glyph_minorwarrior.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" /> </a>– Personal favorite, simply because getting 20 free rage without taking damage every minute is great. Slightly better than Battle because with that 20 free rage I can throw up a new shout every minute for free of charge and begin a fight with 10 rage. All around a useful glyph and definitely has helped me a lot leveling. "

Quite possibly I should have opted for the above glyph over the Battle one.

Once you hit level 30 your next major glyph opens up. Based on the reading I have done, go for:

"<strong><a title="Glyph of Sweeping Strikes" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=43428">Glyph of Sweeping Strikes</a></strong><a title="Glyph of Sweeping Strikes" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=43428"> <img title="Warrior major glyph" src="http://tank-n-spank.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/16px-Inv_glyph_majorwarrior.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" /> </a>– Another integral part of Arms leveling. You will kill two mobs at the same time, for free, taking hardly any extra damage. This makes leveling so much faster and efficient. Combined with a MS crit and an Overpower crit you can easily two-three shot mobs equal to your level at this stage, extremely useful! "

Then you are going to have to wait til level 50 for the next glyph and it's only  a minor one. Depending on what you choose @ 15 go for either Glyph of Battle or Glyph of Bloodrage.

I will be switching over to protection around level 6,0 so I won't be focusing anymore on <acronym title="Damage Per Second">DPS</acronym> based glyphs but for completeness sake, the next glyphs are available:
<ul>
	<li>@ 70 - 3 minor</li>
	<li>@ 80 - 3 major</li>
</ul>
