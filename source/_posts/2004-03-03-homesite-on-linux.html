<p>Steve Erat has an entry on his <a href="http://www.talkingtree.com/blog/index.cfm?data=20040129#65213609-45A6-2844-7768DF9B2E68372D" title="Running the ColdFusion IDE HomeSite+ on Red Hat 9 Linux">blog</a> on how he set up Homesite+ to run on RedHat using Wine. Getting so close now to be able to switch over, if only I could get my wireless card to work under Linux. Incidentally he also has a whole raft of other information relating to ColdFusion.</p>
