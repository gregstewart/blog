Just a testing video captured using fraps and merged using iMovie.

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/17758473" width="600" height="338" frameborder="0"></iframe><p><a href="http://vimeo.com/17758473">Clearly - Normal Utgard Keep</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user2724002">Greg Stewart</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

One of the interesting things I noticed was that hello I am a clicker :) As a result of watching this video, I re-arranged my UI quite a bit and set up a number of key bindings. Still getting used to the new set up, I guess it'll take time for the muscle memory to set in.
