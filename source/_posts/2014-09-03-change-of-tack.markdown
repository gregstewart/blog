Another one of those quick posts on state of play about the [book project](https://www.gitbook.io/book/gregstewart/modern-web-app-development).
First off while updates have been a little slow of late (summer, holidays, work, etc...) I have been busy-ish planning the
next chapters of the book and hope to push some of these out by the end of the month.

I am also please to reveal that over at [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.io/book/gregstewart/modern-web-app-development), some
130 people have been viewing the book, which is just awesome and roughly 129 more people than I had hoped for! I also see that one person
would be willing to buy the book over at [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/building-a-web-app-guided-by-tests/).

One thing though is that I have had 0 feedback on the book and it's content. I have pondered this
for some time now and I have decided to change the book from free to paid. The reasoning being that paying customers might
speak up some more about any issues or better yet things that they like! So starting today I am changing the book to paid on
[GitBook](https://www.gitbook.io/book/gregstewart/modern-web-app-development), starting at $5.00 for the first section.
If you purchase it now you will of course get the updates/fixes and subsequent chapters as they are written. I have also
published a copy over at [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/building-a-web-app-guided-by-tests/). You can still
get a free version of the book over at [my gihub repository](https://github.com/gregstewart/book), reading it that way won't be
nearly as enjoyable as using Gitbook's reader or the many eBook options you can get with [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.io/)
 or [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/). Of course there always the blog posts of the chapters, however I do ask suggest that
 if you like the book and it's content, that maybe buying it is not such a bad idea after all :)

 As always please let me know your thoughts and feedback.
