Hat tip to the webreference news letter which pointed me to an article over at builder.com, which looks at default stylesheets. I did not realise that most browsers have an in-built default style sheet that helps control the default behaviour of html pages (such as hiding the head tag or by default all tags should be displayed as block elements [which if removed amusingly displays everything in-line]). It goes on to point to several sources (<a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2004/09/" title="Really Undoing html.css">Eric Meyer</a>, <a href="http://tantek.com/log/2004/undohtml.css" title="undohtml.css">Tantek</a> and <a href="http://leftjustified.net/journal/2004/10/19/global-ws-reset/" title="Global White Space Reset">Andrew Krespanis</a>) who have looked more closely at the html.css default browser stylesheet (this is the default stylesheet for FireFox I believe) and carried various little experiments.
