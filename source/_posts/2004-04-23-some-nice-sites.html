<p>Just a couple of sites I stumbled across today and would like to make a note of:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.airbag.ca/" title="Airbag - The World's Safest Website">Airbag - The World's Safest Website</a>: simply a cool design with some inspiring comments in his code.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.shauninman.com/" title="ShaunInman.com">ShaunInman.com</a>: again beautifully designed site, with a really cool unordered pop up list in CSS. He is also the mind behind the FIR and now the Inman Flash Replacement technique</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/index.php" title="asterisk* | D. Keith Robinson's Web Design Blog.">asterisk* | D. Keith Robinson's Web Design Blog</a>, web standards, css and Flash... and of course another beautiful design</li>
</ul>
