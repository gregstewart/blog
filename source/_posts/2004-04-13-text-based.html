<p>I had stumbled across <a href="http://textbased.com/~minimalist/" title="textbased.com &gt;&gt; Minimalist Web Project">this site</a> ages ago and I loved is so much that it inspired me to a design in a minimalist kind of approach and more importantly gave me my first taste of web standards. Somehow I lost the address, but thanks to <a href="http://hownow.brownpau.com/" title="how now, brownpau">how now, brownpau</a>, I found it again!!</p>
