A requirement arose whereby I needed to trap the user hitting the enter key to submit a form. Courtesy of the <a href="http://www.flash-lists.com/" title="Flash Developer Mailing List archives">Flash List</a> here is the code in question, just remember to place it in your init() statement:

[as]// special listener to trap to enter key
myReturnKey = new Object();
myReturnKey.onKeyDown = function (){
  var _$key = Key.getCode();

  //   now check for when ENTER is pressed
  if (_$key == 13) {
    // enter key was pressed go do something
  }
}
Key.addListener(myReturnKey);[/as]
