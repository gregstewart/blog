<p>The guys behind CFEclipse, a CFML plug for then eclipse editor have released a new update and it's hosted on <a href="http://cfeclipse.tigris.org/" title="CFEclipse project">a new site</a>.</p>
<p>You can also find some more information and resources over on <a href="http://www.dopefly.com/pages/cfeclipse.html" title="CFEclipse Resource Page">Nathan Strutz's page</a>, which has some good info on getting started with Eclipse (which isn't as obvious as it may seem if you are used to CFStudio or Dreamweaver).</p>
