p>And yet another week has flown by and yet another deluge of items in my inbox</p>
<ol>
  <li>a whole raft of Google information today. First off a interesting look at <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/69/google.html">Google and it's philosophy</a>, is up at <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/">FastCompany</a>. Which led me to <a href="http://www.norvig.com/">this site</a>. Norvig is the director of Search Quality @ Google, just interesting to see some of the people behind this great search engine. Then there was <a href="http://searchenginewatch.com/searchday/03/sd0317-prstanford.html">this on SearchEngine Watch</a>. Mind boggling, I wish I could be more descriptive, but erm it just didn't make sense to me...</li>
  <li>and now to a book review on... Google (specifically hacks and search tips), courtesy of slashdot! <a href="http://books.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/11/1448253&amp;mode=thread&tid=95">Read the review</a> at <a href="http://www.slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596004478/qid=1048040275/teacupinastor-20">find the book at Amazon.com</a>. This sparked my interest in the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis/">Google API</a>, might well have to have a tinker some day.</li>
  <li>Enough with Google time for something different: looking for version 1.0 of Internet Explorer? God knows why but you can <a href="http://www.oldversion.com/">find it here</a></li>
  <li>As a web developer, I am quite interested in how other sites review their implementations and the conclusions they draw from these reviews. Hence take a look at the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/special/progress_report/beta1/">"Macromedia.com Progess report: Beta 1"</a>. And here are the <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/special/progress_report/">survey results for Beta 2</a>.</li>
  <li>Hot on the heels of this topic Douglas Bowman, has written a piece on <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/log/default.asp?date=20030317">"Designing in Public"</a>. The way to go? A break from the norm, where every site had to be perfect before launch (and how often did that happen??), maybe this is a viable way forward. Small steps... always a good approach as far as I am concerned.</li>
  <li>Some SSL stuff. It was recently revealed that SSL was vulnerable and not the be all and end all of secure communications [well nothing ever is]. <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/crypto-gram-0303.html#1">At this location</a> you can have read of the truth behind that statement. Interesting to note that hackers wouldn't bother eavesdropping on a communication between a browser and a server (with or without SSL), but rather go for the database that stores the sensitive information. Why gather information one by one, when you can get it in bulk...</li>
