<p>Martin Cleave and <a href="http://gregs.teacupinastorm.com/" title="read Greg's log">Greg Stewart</a> are the driving force behind TCIAS. They met back in Sydney in the year of the 2000 Olympics while working for <a href="http://www.sapient.com/" title="Go to the Sapient web site">Sapient</a>. Since then they have <a href="/v2/about_us/portfolio/" title="see our portfolio">collaborated</a> on a number of projects that made them realize, that they work well together and we deliver good solutions.</p>
<p>So in early 2003, upon their return to London, England they set about forming TCIAS. Since then they have been involved in getting <a href="/v2/about_us/portfolio/reach_conferencing.php" title="see what we did for Reach Conferencing">Reach Conferencing</a> on-line, built an on-line registration and self assessment system for the <a href="/v2/about_us/portfolio/chandler_macleod_group.php" title="see what we did for the ChandlerMacleod Group">ChandlerMacleod Group</a>, to name but two of the projects in their <a href="/v2/about_us/portfolio/" title="see our portfolio">portfolio</a>.</p>
<p>The decision to set up their own web design/development shop was easy. Martin fills the creative and Greg the implementation boots. Both continuously strive to deliver exceptionally creative and technically optimised solutions that exceed both their client?s expectations and in turn their user?s needs.</p>
