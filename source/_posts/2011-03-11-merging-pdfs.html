I have just posted two small utility functions to merge PDF documents together for those working in CF. You can view them <a href="https://gist.github.com/866034">here</a> . Or inline below.

The first function takes an array of PDF documents and merges them into one. This was handy when different pages for a report had different styling requirements (such a full background colouring bleeding across the margins)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/866034.js?file=gistfile1.cfm"></script>

The second function stamps a pdf document over another pdf document at certain position. I needed this for a document that had a table dynamically generated that spanned multiple pages and I wanted the footer to not overlap the table content (I could not figure out how to use a css based solution because of the margins).

Anyway maybe somebody else will find these handy.
