Man pages are just a great way to find out information about the commands and their various switches on *nix based systems. One thing that has always slightly bothered me though was when you had really long man pages and were looking for a specific switch and it's associated information you needed to page through all of the information. But as I just found out, you don't have to. While reading the man page simply type: /-Z (where -Z is the switch you want to look up) and you'll jump straight to the information you were looking for.
