<p>Mark Mandel put up <a href="http://www.compoundtheory.com/?action=displayPost&amp;ID=4" title="Reasons I hate XMLTransform()">a post and some code</a> for a ColdFusion function that he wrote which uses the underlying Java architecture to do some XSL transformations using the Xalan engine and thus by passing the built-in xmltransform() function that doesn't support xsl:param and xsl:import. Might come in handy for future reference. [<a href="http://www.cfmentor.com/code/index.cfm?action=script&amp;id=136" title="xslTransformFile">Massimo Foti put up something similar a while back</a>.]</p>
