One of the other completely new aspects of my job has been working with xmlHTTPRequest and XML/XSL transformation. And here are a few things that I learned during my last project: you can use conditional statements. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/xsl_if.asp" title="XSLT - The &lt;xsl:if&gt; Element">W3schools</a> proved very helpful in getting to grips with this.

You can do <strong>if</strong> like statements:

[xml]
<xsl:if test="expression">
Do something
</xsl:if>[/xml]

And <strong>if/else</strong> statements:

[xml]
<xsl:choose>
<xsl:when test="expression">
Do something
</xsl:when>
<xsl:otherwise>
Do something else
</xsl:otherwise>
</xsl:choose>
[/xml]

The test expressions can be made up of: "=", "and", "&lt;", "&amp; amp;gt;" and probably a whole lot more, but I haven't come across any other ones yet.
