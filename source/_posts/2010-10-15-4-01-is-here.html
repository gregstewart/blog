It's been three days since the patch hit and rung in all the changes. Since I am still levelling, I can't comment on the DPS issues that warriors face since the patch came (the sky is always falling for some after a patch), but all I can say is I am really enjoying the changes. There were a few head scratching moments and a bit of disappointment to see certain abilities disappear or be moved to higher levels. I miss you <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=20252">Intercept</a>, it was such a short lived affair before you were taken away from me :). Two more levels and we shall be re-united.

Here's <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/talent#LZcrrcszo:zZwZ0">the build</a> I settled on. I only have the prime and minor glyphs equipped as I find <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=67483">Glyph of Death Wish</a> is just overpriced on Stormrage. 8o gold a pop and while I can understand that due to the changes glyphs are no longer disposable and a price rise was to be expected, I still think the price is a little steep.  As an alternative I have been considering <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=43431">Glyph of Victory Rush</a>.

Anyone who has ever levelled a warrior knows the pain of killing a few creatures, stop, sit down to eat, rinse and repeat all the way to the level cap. Now however, there's no more downtime! The change to <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=34428">Victory Rush</a> combined with <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=23885">Bloodthirst</a>, now easily allows us to storm into group after group of mobs and never really have to worry about your health or having to pause. Fury warriors are now truly a continuous killing machine, making levelling a breeze.

I also tanked a few instances as Fury and was pleased to see that my rage generation was no longer a problem. Threat generation wasn't too bad either. <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=6673">Battle Shout</a> (I did miss Bloodrage for about 2 minutes, but now that BS generates rage...) , run in, <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=6343">Thunderclap</a>, tab target <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=7386">Sunder Armor</a>, then all you need to is <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=845">Cleave</a> and <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=6343">TC</a>, whenever it's up and mobs should stick to you just fine, satisfying all of your groups AOE needs. Now that the patch has lowered the cost of Dual Talent specialisation to 100 gold, I will soon take a peak at the tanking tree and giving it a whirl.

My final comment is about the update to the textures, how gorgeous are they know? The water itself just makes me want to jump into it every time I see a puddle big enough!
