Someone asked the question about using jrun.security.NTAuth and how you would log them out. I have only ever used it as an authentication method, i.e. rather than checking against say a database, I would check against the domain controller to verify the user's credentials. So in the context of logging into an application I would check for the existence of a session variable, if not found validate the user submitted credentials against NTAuth and if true I created a session object and that indicated that the user was logged in. To log out simply let the session expire or clear the session structure, pretty simple.

Is this how you use it?
