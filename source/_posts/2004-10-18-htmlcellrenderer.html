I keep finding myself returning to PhilFlash's web site for some truly useful classes he has written that extend the dataGrids functionality. A few weeks back I stumbled across his site when I was trying to figure out how to modify the header style. This week I was trying to change the way the data in the columns was being displayed, i.e. I wanted the text to wrap if it was too long for the column. A simple notion you would have thought, but alas no!

sing Phil's HtmlCellRenderer class you can achieve this effect. It's use is pretty straightforward and his code is self explanatory. Including the AS file is done by way of inserting a new symbol on your time line. With the following properties:
<ul>
	<li>Name : HtmlCellRenderer</li>
	<li>Behavior : MovieClip : Checked</li>
	<li>Identifier: HtmlCellRenderer</li>
	<li>AS 2.0 Class : HtmlCellRenderer</li>
	<li>Export for Actionscript : Checked</li>
	<li>Export for in first frame : Checked</li>
</ul>
You can actually nicely include the script and formatting instructions in the special header AS file I discussed a few weeks back <a href="http://gregs.teacupinastorm.com/flash/datagrid_headers.php" title="DataGrid Headers">here</a> and <a href="http://gregs.teacupinastorm.com/flash/more_datagrid_header_styling.php" title="More DataGrid Header Styling">here</a>
