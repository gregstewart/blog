Apologies for the long long pause in posting any updates to this site, but between some pretty heavy project work, planning our move back to Australia, leaving my current job, finding some short term contract work, re-building the CMS for this site (&amp; v2 is nearly ready as a matter of fact this post was submitted using it), investing way too many hours in playing <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/" title="World of Warcraft">Wow</a>, dealing with a compromised server and enjoying the first signs of summer here in the UK, I just haven't found a moment to post. It doesn't mean that I haven't figured out anything new or haven't stumbled across interesting posts and sites, as a matter of fact I have... tons of them... so hopefully there should be a deluge of posts coming real soon, starting right now!

Oh and did I mentioned we are moving back to Australia?? :)
