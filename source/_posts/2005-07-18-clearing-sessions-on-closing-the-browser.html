I keep seeing this question pop up so for google's sake here is how you can kill sessions when the user closes his or her browser.

[html]<!--- set session coookies --->
<cfif>
<cfcookie name="cfid" value="#cookie.cfid#">
<cfcookie name="cftoken" value="#cookie.cftoken#">
</cfcookie>
[/html]</cfcookie></cfif>
