The <a href="http://www.mach-ii.com/" title="Mach-ii">Mach-ii framework</a> conveniently passes your form and url variables into the event for you and you can access these values from within <acronym title="ColdFusion Components">CFC</acronym> by passing them into your method using:

[code]<cfargument name="event" type="MachII.framework.Event" required="yes" displayname="Event" hint="I am the current event." />[/code]

Now if you wanted to access the value for a submitted form field called "myOption", you could access it using the following syntax:

[code]<cfset var mySetOption = arguments.event.getArg("myOption") />[/code]

And now this value can easily be used and passed into your queries or whatever you want to do with it within that method.
