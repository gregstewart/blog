I recently upgraded MySQL from version 3.x to 4.1.12 and when I tried to access one of my web apps that was using the new database server it returned an error. I didn't make a note of the error at the time, but it was squarely pointing at an authentication problem. I remembered <a href="http://blog.daemon.com.au/archives/000304.html" title="Upgrading mySQL from 4.0 to 4.1">a post on the Daemonite blog</a> on the topic which provided the solution. Since I had re-created from scratch the user accounts that accessed the database, MySQL had used it's new password hash algorithm, but the PHP (at least version 4.3.11) <strong>mysql</strong> extension was not able to apply it. So the solution is thankfully straightforward, just reset the password using the OLD_PASSWORD function instead of just PASSWORD. Here is what you would type from within the MySQL client:

<code>[sql]UPDATE mysql.user
SET password=OLD_PASSWORD('youPassword')
WHERE user='yourUser'
AND host='localhost';[/sql]</code>
