I hope that people will find this project useful in their day to day development.

So what is Stubbie? The short and sweet is: it creates a set of test stub objects to be used in your unit tests based on your projects CFCs.

Slightly more protracted: Stubbie was inspired by a feature in Rails that creates stub test objects based on objects found in your application.

You can run Stubbie standalone or as a plugin (there is a Mach-ii plugin available) and on execution it will recursively examine your projects code for CFCs and generate generic test objects for you, as well as a Test Suite. No more excuses to not use Unit Testing.

It currently supports both CFUnit and CFCUnit.

It's all a bit slap dash right now, but I hope to tidy things up in the near future (and actually upload some code for you to download). Of course feedback, critiques and suggestions are always welcome.
