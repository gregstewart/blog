<p>And now for something a little different. A few days back I was just contemplating finding a way to play Manic Mansion again. Lo and behold, some kind soul on Slashdot provided a link to <a href="http://people.freenet.de/lucasfangames/maniac/games_eng.htm" title="Manic Mansion Deluxe">Manic Mansion Deluxe</a>. The site also hosts a Zak McKracken game. If you have found memories of these classics point and click adventure games, then head on over there and grab yourself a copy. It's free! Both games were built using <a href="http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/" title="Adventure Game Studio">Adventure Game Studio</a> and that is free too.</p>
