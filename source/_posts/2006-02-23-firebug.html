Now I can't remember where I stumbled across this little gem of a plug in for FireFox: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=1843&amp;application=firefox">FireBug</a>, but yesterday it completely surprised me.

I originally had installed it because it was meant to be far better at debugging <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym>, than the new version of the JavaScript Console that was shipped with FireFox 1.5 and that it was. So I have been using it for a while now, but yesterday I stumbled across a feature that makes it utterly invaluable now. I do a lot of <acronym title="Asynchronous JavaScript + XML">Ajax</acronym> based development these days and sometimes trying to figure out what is going on under the hood is a little problematic. However if you open it up and look at the options, you'll see an option to show XmlHttpRequests disabled. Enable it and make a remoting call.

Along with the usual <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym>/<acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> debug you should now see something like this:

<a href="//www.tcias.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/firebug1.png" title="Firebug screenshot 1"><img src="//www.tcias.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/firebug1.png" alt="Firebug screenshot 1" /></a>

If you click on the Response Tab you can see what has been returned to the browser.

<a href="//www.tcias.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/firebug2.png" title="Firebug screenshot 2"><img src="//www.tcias.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/firebug2.png" alt="Firebug screenshot 2" /></a>

And if you click on the <acronym title="JavaScript">JS</acronym> tab you can inspect the whole response object.

<a href="//www.tcias.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/firebug3.png" title="Firebug screenshot 3"><img src="//www.tcias.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/firebug3.png" alt="Firebug screenshot 3" /></a>

Awesome!
