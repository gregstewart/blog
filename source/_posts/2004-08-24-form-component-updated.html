I have finally found a second to update my form <acronym title="ColdFusion Component">CFC</acronym> and it now includes hidden input,textarea input and form validation integration with my JavaScript form validation script. I also had to change the way the form was initialised. <acronym title="ColdFusion MX">CFMX</acronym> was having intermittent issues with &lt;cfsavecontent&gt;. Instead I now simply set a variable. You can grab the <a href="http://gregs.tcias.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/form.zip" title="Form.zip">latest version here</a>.
