As I indicated in on of my previous posts, announcing an event does not behave like a re-direct, instead the event is simply added to the event queue and processed sequentially. In order to in effect abort the event you need to do the following call:

[code]arguments.eventContext.clearEventQueue()[/code]

If this needs to occur in a plugin remember to place this call in the pre-process section.
