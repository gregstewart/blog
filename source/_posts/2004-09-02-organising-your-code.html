A little snippet from <a href="http://www.corfield.org" title="An Architect's View">Sean Corfield's post</a> to the Mach-ii dev list and I think is extremely useful and simple way to organise your code, especially when applied to the mach-ii.xml configuration file.

<em>"we order events public first then private, alphabetically within those groups"</em>

Also Sean pointed out that if the number of lines should exceed 1500 lines (use your judgment here) one should consider breaking out the one application into, several smaller ones. Furthermore by using the same application name, the smaller applications could then still share sessions.
