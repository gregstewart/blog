And welcome to the inaugural post! The idea behind Tank and spank has been bubbling round in the back of my head for quite some time now. You see I have been playing WoW for well over 5 years now (I know , I know <acronym title="Grats on no life">GONL</acronym>!!), and I have been tanking and staring at crotches for almost all of that time. I have had many highs, a few lows, a few burnt out moments, but overall I have always had a lot of fun.

Back in May 2010, I decided that I needed a break from the game. We were moving back to the UK, we had a new born, Cataclysm was around the corner, ICC held little in the way of interest. So I let me account elapse, and said good bye to :

</ul>
And Â a bunch of other characters at various levels. I have been keeping up on alpha and beta news and with all the changes coming our way it truly looks like a new game is on the horizon. So I started planning this little site and by planning really I mean thinking about an idea. I wanted to write a little about the game I love, I wanted to write about tanking. I wanted to keep track of the changes to Tanking and share my thoughts. However I also wanted to explore making movies and using some of the social networking tools out there to find like minded individuals and to engage with.

Enough rambling for now, without further ado I bid you farewell until the next post.
