After yet another short hiatus we managed to find our way back in Blackwing Descent. This time I remembered to capture the <a title="Omnotron Defense System" href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=42179">Omnotron Defense System</a> encounter :) .

After a few false starts on Maloriak, we were able to down him again as well and that opened up <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/npc=41442/atramedes">Atramades</a> for us. Once again not an overly challenging encounter I thought, pretty much tank and spank with a little bit of running round during his air phase. A little tip if you are playing a Paladin, if he targets you with his <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=78353">Roaring Flame Breath</a>, simply use your <a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=1022">Hand of Protection</a> and he will shift his attention to someone else during the air phase.
