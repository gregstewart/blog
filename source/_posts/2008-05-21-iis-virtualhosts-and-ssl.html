For posterity, if you are configuring several websites, that use the same IP/port combination for SSL and you are using host headers to identify them, then you'll need to<a title="Configuring SSL Host Headers (IIS 6.0)" href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/596b9108-b1a7-494d-885d-f8941b07554c.mspx?mfr=true"> follow these steps</a>, particularly <a title="Configuring Server Bindings for SSL Host Headers (IIS 6.0)" href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/WindowsServer2003/Library/IIS/596b9108-b1a7-494d-885d-f8941b07554c.mspx?mfr=true">this one here</a>. Always strikes me as odd that when you basically have everything in a GUI, for the final step you have to crak open the command line. Especially when you consider that you don't need to do anything for multiple hosts on port 80.
