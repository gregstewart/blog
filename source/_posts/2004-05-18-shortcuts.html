<p>Came across two handy little keyboard shortcuts that I did not know about previously.</p>
<ul>
	<li>When using Dreamweaver MX you can jump ahead to any line of code, by hitting <strong>CTRL+G</strong>, which brings up a little dialogue box where you can specify the line number you want to jump to.</li>
	<li>To quickly edit a field or a rename a file name in Windows, simply select it and hit <strong>F2</strong>.</li>
</ul>
