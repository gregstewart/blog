<p>I have just started using BlueDragon on this server here and have come across a small (un-documented) discrepancy between the BD implementation of CFML and that of CFMX. When using the queryName.columnList variable CFMX decides to alphabetically order the column names from your select statement. BD on the other hand doesn't. I was most surprised that CFMX ordered the columnList for you.</p>
<p>One other thing I spotted and this is in the documentation, is that cfscript does not support try/catch. Apparently this will be addressed in the upgrade patch for version 6.2, which is due out in September/October.</p>
