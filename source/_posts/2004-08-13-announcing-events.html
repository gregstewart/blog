There are two ways that you can announce events in the <a href="http://www.mach-ii.com/" title="Mach-ii">Mach-ii framework</a>. The first way is inside a <acronym title="ColdFusion Component">CFC</acronym> (typically I believe a Listener) and that is by calling the <strong>announceEvent()</strong> method and passing in the event name and any arguments that you wish to pass along as well. For example:

[code]<cfset announceEvent("someEvent",arguments.event.getArgs()) />[/code]

The other way is in the <em>mach-ii.xml</em> config file. Here you can make use of the following syntax to announce a new event

[code]<announce event="someEvent" />[/code]

Just make sure you have an event-handler set for "someEvent". And also do note that announcing events is not like re-directing to that event. This adds the event to the event queue.
