<p>The inbox for 31/5/2003, the first one posted in Blighty and the focus this week is mainly on lists and style sheets. It's also the first post with full titles in the <strong>href</strong> tags and <strong>acronym</strong> identifiers... it's all very exciting and accessible.</p>
<ol>
	<li>A cool way to highlight links in the body of text <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~stuartr/articles/missinglink.shtml" title="The Search for the Missing Link">is shown here</a>, barely visible until you cursor roles over the paragraph in question. In this example though it's a little too subtle.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.kalsey.com/tools/csstabs/index.php?section=3" title="CSS Tabs with Submenus"></a>Now this I really like, a list based css formatted tabbed menu and it's even got <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> show/hide sub menus. <a href="http://kalsey.com/2003/05/css_tabs_with_submenus/">Here</a> you can read more about the background on the development of this technique.</li>
	<li>The <acronym title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</acronym> has ,finally,
	  put up a comprehensive list of all<a href="http://www.w3.org/QA/2002/04/valid-dtd-list.html" title="List of valid DTDs you can use in your document."> the
	  valid DTDs</a> (<acronym title="Document Type Definition">DTD</acronym>)</li>
	<li>On dev edge another article on <a href="http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2003/why-web-standards/" title="The Business Benefits of Web Standards">making a business case for fully <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> based sites</a></li>
	<li>Accessify.com has an <a href="http://www.accessify.com/articles/an-interview-with-bruce-lawson.asp" title="Accessify.com - Interview with DMXzone's Bruce Lawson, accessibility and standards evangelist">interview with Bruce Lawson</a>, on standards, accessibility and Dreamweaver.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.macrabbit.com/cssedit/" title="CSSEdit">Just a darn cool example</a> of using PNG opacity.</li>
	<li>From A List Apart another quite superb article on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/taminglists/" title="CSS Design: Taming lists">Taming
	    lists</a>. Which pointed me to this article on dev edge <a href="http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2002/list-indent/" title="Consistent List Indentation">on
	    list indentation.</a></li>
	<li>The first inclusion is a <acronym title="Dynmic Hyper Text Markup Language">dHTML</acronym> style drop menu using style sheets <a href="http://www.gazingus.org/dhtml/?id=109" title="Using lists for dHTML menus">at Gazingus.org</a>. However that site still made use of JavaScript to get the pop up working whereas <a href="http://www.designmeme.com/articles/csspulldownmenu.shtml" title="Pure CSS Pulldown Menus">this version here</a>, makes full use of <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>. Downside only work in the latest browsers (read Mozilla... :)).</li>
	<li><acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> watch has an <a href="http://www.cmswatch.com/Features/PeopleWatch/FeaturedPeople/?feature_id=90" title="Content Management and Information Architecture">Interview with Lou Rosenfeld</a> on <acronym title="Information Architecture">IA</acronym> and CMSs. He explains the differences between the two (IA = Spatial, CM = flow), looks at the disciplines and highlights some of the different type of IA approaches and styles there are.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" title="The beauty in CSS design">Here is a site</a>, which demonstrates the awesome power of CSS.</li>
	<li>Over at Dev Edge a interesting article on <a href="http://devedge.netscape.com/viewsource/2003/inner-browsing/" title="Inner-Browsing: Extending Web Browsing the Navigation Paradigm">Inner
	    browsing</a>, i.e. getting page elements to make remote calls to a server
	    to update dynamically</li>
	<li>After looking at the <a href="http://www.segpub.com.au/" title="design.develop.host">Segment
	    Publishing</a> (incidentally a beautifully developed site in xHTML and CSS),
	    I spotted a set of geographical related tags in the source code. These
	    are used for geographic based search engines. I investigated these a little
	    as I had decided to add some <strong>geo</strong> tags to my pages as well. The site is
	    with all the info can be <a href="http://geotags.com/" title="Location based search engine">found
	    here</a>. It also had a set of <acronym title="Thesaurus of Geograpic Names">tgn</acronym> tags,
	    and here is <a href="http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabulary/tgn/" title="Getty Thesaurus of Geograpic Names - search">a
	    tool</a> for determining yours. Searching for my location returned the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/TGNFullDisplay?find=Wandsworth&place=&nation=United+Kingdom&prev_page=1&english=Y&subjectid=7018933" title="TGN result set for Wandsworth">following
	    result</a>. Once you have completed all the tags you can <a href="http://www.geourl.com/ping/" title="GEO Url">submit
	    it to the search engine here</a>.</li>
</ol>
