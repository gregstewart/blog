I found myself having to trap a user attempting to refresh a page for one of our web apps. After a little bit of digging I stumbled across <a href="http://webreference.com/dhtml/diner/beforeunload/bunload4.html" title="The IE onBeforeUnload Event Handler">this solution</a>:

[code]
<script type="text/javascript"> 
<!-- 
window.onbeforeunload = unloadMess; 
function unloadMess()
{
 	mess = "You are about to refresh the screen and will loose all of your changes.nAre you sure you want to do so?" 	return mess; 
} 
//--> 
</script>[/code]

To use it simply embed or include it into your template

Eventhough the article says this is a IE specific event/feature it also works in FireFox. You should be aware that whenever the user leaves the page, they will be prompted about their impeding data loss, which can get a little tedious while developing.

Again this became a handy feature for our AJAX apps as most of the processing is done in the background without the page reload, a user could accidentally hit the back button and loose where they were at.
