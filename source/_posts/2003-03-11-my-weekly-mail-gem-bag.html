<p>This weeks mail bag contained a few gems</p>

<ol>
 <li>Jakob Nielsen's review, the pontif of all things usable, of a book on persuasive design. Check it out here: <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030303.html">http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030303.html</a> and remember it's for the kids!!!</li>

 <li>Over at <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">the register</a> a snippet about <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/29511.html">ten common e-commerce site flaws</a>. I don't think one can ever have enough check lists to check our work against! Slightly related is this list of top <a href-"http://www.sans.org/top20/">20 vulnerabilities</a> and since we all need web servers there is some info on specific vulnearbilities for IIS and Apache</li>

 <li>Starting a business? Thinking of becoming an entrepreneur?? <a href="http://hbsworkingknowledge.hbs.edu/pubitem.jhtml?id=3348&t=entrepreneurship">This interview with Constance Bagley @ the Harvard Business School web site</a> has some useful information</li>

 <li>And now for stuff I came across on <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/">Zeldman's site</a>: Check out this link to <a href="http://www.hiveware.com/enkoder_form.php">http://www.hiveware.com/enkoder_form.php</a>. A script that takes your "mailto:" address and turns it into encrypted string and uses Javascript to write it to the page. Pretty marvellous and that should hinder some of those nasty little spam bots gleaning mail addresses from web pages. A nifty and low effort alternative to using forms to mail enquiries to you!</li>

 <li><a href="http://www.easyrgb.com/harmonies.php">http://www.easyrgb.com/harmonies.php</a>, if you are like me and struggle with colour schemes for web sites, try this script. Absolutely fantastic!</li>

 <li>a little bit of light entertainment: <a href="http://www.trevorvanmeter.com/flyguy/">check out fly guy</a>. Lovely animation and a very soothing experience</li>
</ol>
