A few week old now, but Doug over at Stop Design has come up with <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2005/05/03/css-tip-flags.html" title="CSS Organization Tip 1: Flags">yet another invaluable little trick</a>: when working with large style sheets it can be quite a lot of work to scroll through it in order to locate a certain declaration. His tip, label your sections and prefix the label with "=" like such:

<code>[css]/* MISC: =Lists
----------------------------------------------- */[/css]</code>

Since "=" is not used in CSS, doing a search for =List will quickly get you to where you need to be.

And while you are over at his site, why not read up on his latest collaborative project with <a href="http://www.happycog.com/work/cg/" title="Cap Gemini">Happy Cog</a> and <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/" title="Jeffrey Zeldman presents the daily report">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>: <a hef="http://www.capgemini.com/" title="collaborative business experience">Cap Gemini</a> a glorious CSS/xHTML redesign!
