After many moons and a series of Postalicious links, finally a blog post! Over Easter, I stumbled across a <a href="https://github.com/torkiljohnsen/swipe">swipe library</a> that allows you to create a swipe-able interface a la Path. Since I am working quite a bit with <a href="http://zeptojs.com/">ZeptoJS</a> these days I had a stab at porting it over. You can find my fork <a href="https://github.com/gregstewart/swipe">here</a>. 

<a href="http://www.torkiljohnsen.com/">Torkil</a> has kindly merged some of the changes I have into his repo. Go check out Torkil's work, it's pretty awesome!
