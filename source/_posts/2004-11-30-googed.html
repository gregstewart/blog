A few days back I got a message from <a href="http://blog.daemon.com.au/" title="Daemonite: the MX Technology blog of TeamDaemon">Geoff Bowers</a> letting me know that I have been added to <a href="http://www.fullasagoog.com/" title="fullasagoog: Rich Internet Application Goodness">FullAsAGoog</a>. If you haven't been here before, welcome!
