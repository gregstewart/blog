<p>Just as I had settled for a background I visited to <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/" title="Authentic Boredom">Cameron Moll&#8217;s</a> blog and then I noticed it, I had chosen the same background as he had. Funny how the mind works, so I went back to <a href="http://www.squidfingers.com/patterns/" title="squidfingers/patterns">Squidfingers</a> and chose a new pattern and also chose a new color.</p>
<p>I also fixed an <a href="http://www.awstats.org/" title="Free real-time logfile analyzer to get advanced statistics">awstats</a> configuration problem. I was using a shell script to build both the index page and a set of static pages and when it came to building the static pages the process would abort with the following error message:</p>
<p><em>awstats.pl /usr/bin/perl: bad interpreter: Permission denied</em></p>
<p>The solution: the awstats.pl script did not have execute permissions at a group level.</p>
<p>As a result I have now been able to see who's been looking at my site and was pleased to see a nice spread of browsers and OSs. Which made me wonder how the site renders. I have to be honest I basically only use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/start/" title="Mozilla: FireFox">FireFox</a> and occasionally look at it in IE 6.0 (and usually spot a few errors). So I was wondering if possibly some of you who look at this site could <script language="JavaScript1.2" type="text/javascript" src="/_common/_scripts/_email.js"></script> and send me a screen grab if you spot any display errors? Ta, in advance.</p>
