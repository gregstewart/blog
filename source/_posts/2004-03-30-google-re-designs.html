<p>Google has re-designed, and it certainly looks leaner and meaner, however a peak under the hood reveals not exactly web standards code, by virtue of missing quotes around attributes and even the odd &lt;font&gt; tag. I can't help but wonder why they didn't go for the full standards approach, after all it is supposed to reduce the bloat of your code and in turn cut down on bandwidth (which in Google's case must be astronomical). So why no Standards? I can only speculate that after analysis they opted for this solution as it provided the greatest benefits in terms of savings and efficiency. Certainly dropping all of the double quotes would reduce the page weight, though I still can't find a rational for the &lt;font&gt; tag =-1 value. Would a style rule really weigh that much? Especially if you externalised the <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> file? Hmm?</p>
