I new it was possible, just never took the time to <a title="[SVN] Recursively delete .svn folders" href="http://blog.snakehit.be/2007/08/29/svn-recursively-delete-svn-folders/">look it up</a>.

[code]rm -rf `find . -type d -name .svn`[/code]

As with all types of deletes, recursive or not, use with caution.

For windows use:

[code]del /S .svn[/code]
