Courtesy of <a title="NSI Registers Every Domain Checked" href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/01/08/1920215">Slashdot</a>, news that Network Solutions are front running domain names. I don't care much for <a title="Network Solutions Responds to Front Running Accusations" href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/81082_network_solutions_front_running/">their response</a> that this is to protect us, the customer, from evil do-ers. Especially when they charge a <a title="Domain Pricing Chart" href="http://www.networksolutions.com/domain-name-registration/pricing-chart.jsp">premium</a> ($34.99) for their domain names, whereas services like <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/default.asp">Go Daddy</a> offer them for $9.99. Way to go Network Solutions!!
