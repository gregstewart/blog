			<p>Our core beliefs when it comes to design are: user centricity and accessibility, which all flow into our mantra of form follows function. And were would we be without flair and elegance? A clean and content focused interface is paramount to a successful on-line presence. Combining the visual with the functional and accessibility will empower your users to easily complete their tasks.</p>

			<p>At the heart of all on-line solutions lie users and their tasks. The interface can be as beautiful as anything can be, but users will not be fooled by appearances if they cannot use it. A good experience results in return visits and referrals. Do not antagonise your users, empower them!</p>
