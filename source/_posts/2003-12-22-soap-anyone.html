<p>A general collection of odds and sods. Some more ColdFusion framework discussions, some CSS, mobile blogging, some SOAP, PHP and a few interface design considerations.</p>
<ol>
 <li><p>There has been a lot of discussion of the CFDev mailing list over appropriate architectures for developing RIAs, of course all focused also on harnessing the power of CFCs. The bets solution pout forward was to move away form 3 tier applications and look to n-tier applications (items listed after the slash are for Mach-II and typical web applications using HTML templates for the presentation layer): </p>
 	<ol>
		<li>client (web browser)</li>
		<li>presentation tier (Flash UI) / presentation tier (ColdFusion .cfm pages)</li>
		<li>business-presentation tier (Flash ActionScript controller) / business-presentation tier (Mach II &amp; listener CFCs)</li>
		<li>business-facade tier (ColdFusion CFC / web service facade) / business-facade tier (ColdFusion CFC facade)</li>
		<li>business-model tier (ColdFusion CFCs)</li>
		<li>integration tier (ColdFusion CFCs &amp;Java)</li>
		<li>data tier (Oracle 9i)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Below are some link with articles that should provide further insight.<br /></p>

  <li>The <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/slashdot2/" title="Retooling Slashdot with Web Standards Part II">two articles</a> were interesting for a number of reasons. One of course being a showcase of how standards implemented sites could benefit companies.

  <li>I had a script running on this now for quite a while that gathers book info based on what section of the site you are in and then displays the book thumbnails. It works, but I have found it very intermittent. So I decided to dig a little deeper and see if I could fix this up a little.
