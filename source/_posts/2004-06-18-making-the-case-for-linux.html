<p>Another neat <a href="http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2004/06/10/win4lin.html" title="Windows Compatibility for the Linux Desktop">little article</a> on running some of your old Windows programs under Linux. The author talks you through choosing the right emulator for your needs, reviews some of the solutions out there and then takes you through a step by step configuration of <a href="http://www.netraverse.com/products/" title="Products overview">win4lin</a> as this is the one that suited his needs.</p>
<p>The case is becoming more and more compelling, now I just need to make sure all of my hardware is supported.</p>
