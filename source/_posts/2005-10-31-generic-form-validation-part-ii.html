A few weeks back someone on the CFDJ list enquired about JavaScript form validation and pointed them in the direction of my script, however I only just realised that the script itself was no longer working. Oops... so apologies, but I have fixed up the problems and done made it sure it works for the following browsers.
<ul>
	<li>Win XP / Netscape 4.7x</li>
	<li>Win XP / IE 6</li>
	<li>Win XP / Mozilla 1.4</li>
	<li>Win 2K / IE 6</li>
	<li>Win 2K / Mozilla 1.5</li>
	<li>Win XP / Firefox 0.8</li>
</ul>
If you have access to ones not on the list, I'd be grateful for any feedback. The revised version with sample file can be found <a href="http://gregs.tcias.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/validate.zip" title="Validate zip file">here</a>.
