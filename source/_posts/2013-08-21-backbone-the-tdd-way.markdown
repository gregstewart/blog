Or how I decided to give [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/) a whirl and publish a book.

I am not a prolific writer or even a good writer, but I have always enjoyed writing. I have often entertained the idea of writing a book. but was put off by the slow nature of publishing, the long road to getting your content out in front of people.

I like sharing what I find and learn, and the result was this blog. A little like writing a book, without the barriers to entry and I can get my thoughts and writings out quickly.

I work in technology, love what I do and am reasonably good at what I do. I am a big proponent of Agile, I like the visibility you get from the process, the iterative approach, the fail fast nature and continuously improving your project. 

Last year I read a [book](https://leanpub.com/the-retrospective-handbook) published by a an ex-colleague of mine, [Patrick Kua](http://www.thekua.com/atwork/). He used a [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/) to do so and this gave me an idea.

Leanpub's motto is "Publish Early, Publish Often", very agile, very lean. The barrier to publishing has been lowered. Everything is coming together, so today I am happy to announce that I am writing a book. 

I am going to base the book on the series of blog posts I wrote a last year on Backbone.js and Jasmine. The content for those posts is available over at [Github](https://github.com/gregstewart/backbone-jasmine/) and I intend to keep the content of this book freely available over there as well, but for those folks who find/found the content useful, I figured maybe they would also like a book version (and yes maybe make a few quid out of it). If you are interested, then why not [head over the books page](https://leanpub.com/backbonethetddway) and sign up to get notified when it will be available.

The book aims to take you through creating a basic app, introducing you to Backbone.js and using TDD as the guiding principle. Here's a rough list of the chapters:

* Setup
* Building a search interface
* Populating a result page
* Testing routes
* Tying it all together
* Migrating your code to Require.js
* Writing functional tests

I am looking for feedback on the topic, so feel free to raise any issues over there. If you have any suggestions for other areas to be covered please let me know.
