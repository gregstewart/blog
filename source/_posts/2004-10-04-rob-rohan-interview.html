A neat <a href="http://cybersonic.blogspot.com/2004/09/rob-rohan-interview.html" title="Cybersonic:  Rob Rohan Interview">interview with Rob Rohan</a>, the man that started the CFEclipse project. Of note are his choice of plugins (other than CFEclipse of course). Tail Log Viewer is the one I love most so far, but there are other such as a CSS, JS, XML and db one.
