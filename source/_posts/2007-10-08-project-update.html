It's been for ever and a day, since I have done any commits to this project, but prompted by Janet's comments I have made a handful of commits to the repository.

<ol>
<li>cfUnit is now supported</li>
<li>A fix for cfmx 6.1 and recursive directory lookups</li>
<li>The code can now handle missing tearDown methods in existing test cfcs.</li>
</ol>

I have also tried to simplify the config.xml file a little and here's what the default looks like:

[code]
<stubbie>

	<config>
		<appName value="myMapping" /><!-- the name of your app, can be the mapping name as set up in cfadmin -->
		<appPath value="/my/full/path/to/the code/" /><!--full path to the app -->
		<packageRoot value="" /><!-- if you have a mapping for your app's cfcs, e.g. com.mydomain, specify it here (if you have specified an app name the result will be com.mydomain.myapp) -->
		<saveTestFilesTo value="" /><!-- Not implemented yet, optional storage location for the test stubs -->
		<unitTestFramework value="cfcUnit"/><!-- cfcUnit/cfUnit -->
		<coldSpring use="false" path="config/cs.xml"/><!-- (working on it) whether or not to use CS and if so where is the cs config file in relation to the app path -->
	</config>
	
</stubbie>

[/code]

A concrete example usually works best, so:

[code]
<stubbie>
	<config>
		<appName value="art" /><!-- the name of your app, can be the mapping name as set up in cfadmin -->
		<appPath value="/Users/gregstewart/Sites/Client X sites/Fusebox/ART2/" /><!--full path to the app -->
		<packageRoot value="" /><!-- if you have a mapping for your app's cfcs, e.g. com.mydomain, specify it here (if you have specified an app name the result will be com.mydomain.myapp) -->
		<saveTestFilesTo value="" /><!-- Not implemented yet, optional storage location for the test stubs -->
		<unitTestFramework value="cfcUnit"/><!-- cfcUnit/cfUnit -->
		<coldSpring use="false" path="config/cs.xml"/><!-- (working on it) whether or not to use CS and if so where is the cs config file in relation to the app path -->
	</config>
</stubbie>
[/code]

<em>appName</em> : This now refers to a cf mapping in the administrator for my project, in this case art, however if you are using a package approach (with say a value of "com.domain"), then this value would simply be appended to the packageRoot (e.g. com.domain.art)

<em>appPath</em> : This is now the full path to the application, e.g. on my local machine /Users/gregstewart/Sites/Client X sites/Fusebox/ART2/

<em>packageRoot</em> : Hasn't changed

<em>saveTestFilesTo</em> : Hasn't changed

<em>unitTestFramework</em> : Now supports cfUnit.

<em>coldSpring</em> : Something working on, i.e. use ColdSpring to generate mock objects. Could be ages before it sees the light of day, if my past track record is anything to go by.

Thoughts and suggestions are still most welcome!
