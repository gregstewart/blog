<h3>Upsizing Access 97 to SQL server 6.5 Part IV</h3>
<p class="1">I have come across another problem when upsizing my database to SQL from Access. This one pertains to a select statement. This is the code I used to extract the last record in a table.</p>
<p class="1">Code:<br />
<pre>
&lt;cfquery datasource="DataSourceName" name="QueryName"&gt;
SELECT LAST(TableName.FieldName) AS LastOfFieldName FROM TableName
&lt;/cfquery&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p class="1">As you can see I used the Last function and this works fine in Access, but SQL server doesn't recognise this statement and returns an error. So I had to use a slightly more convoluted way to get the last record.</p>
<p class="1">Code:<br />
<pre>
&lt;cfquery datasource="DataSourceName" name="QueryName" maxrows="1"&gt;
Select Tablename.FieldName From TableName
Order by TableName.FieldName DESC
&lt;/cfquery&gt;
</pre>
</p>
<p class="1">
This query selects all the fields and orders them in descending order. You then use the <i>maxrows=</i> statement to limit the output to the first field it retrieves.</p>
