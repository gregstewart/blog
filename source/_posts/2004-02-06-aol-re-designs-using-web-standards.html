<p>The top news for me today was that <a href="http://www.aol.com/" title="AOL">AOL</a> have re-designed and re-launched using a table-less layout and CSS. Another notch for the web standards based design!!! On this note I can't remember if posted this previously, but you can look up the latest standards based web sites, by visiting <a href="http://www.dailystandards.com/" title="the Daily Standards">the Daily Standards</a>.</p>
