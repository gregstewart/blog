<p>So what's all this about then? Well quite frankly I do a lot of stuff everyday, some of it interesting, most of it mundane, but it always boils down to figuring out problems and coming up with solutions. This is all good, however I struggle to remember all the things I learn, figure out or quite simply find useful. I'd much rather focus on solving problems or remembering my beloved's birthday. And that's why I built this site, it does exactly as the tag line indicates helps me remember what I figure out, now all I need to do is put up the stuff that I have figured out over the years.</p>
<p>There a few other reasons behind starting this website. One was to build a CMS and the other was to learn more about PHP. Then there was my interest in WAP and iTV and hence I anted to port the content to those platforms as well. So here we are after 6 months of development the CMS is complete and the site designed for the web. The look and feel of this site went through many many iterations before I finally settled on a minimalist approach. At the end of the day, what swung my design decisions was my needs, and that was to present the information in a clear and simple manner. Another point that was important to me was to make the site standards orientated and I think I have achieved this. I know that some of the older content taken from previous sites is not compliant as yet, but I am working my way through it (and boy is some of the content rough) and in the none to distant future it should be ready. However do feel free to drop me a line if you spot anything that is amiss.</p>
<p>So what's next? Getting the WAP side of things working, the look at making the site iTV enables using the Liberate platform. Also after receiving some positive feedback from others I have decided to make the CMS available to others, so I am currently busy writing documentation, install procedures and setting up a demo site for it. FInally I will revisit these pages to make full use of CSS for the layout of these and finally get rid of tables.</p>
