<p>This weeks mail bag is packed to the brim with links from a wide range of topics. Make your selection from IA, web, design, book reviews and site reports.</p>

<ol>
	<li>From the web reference news letter, <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/04/16/dive-into.html">an introduction by Mark Pilgrim to xHTML2</a>. It reviews the &lt;br /&gt; and &lt;style&gt; and details what they have been replaced with. IN a following article he will be talking about the &lt;img&gt; tag which is currently generating a lot of discussion.</li>
	<li>From the web reference news letter, <a href="http://ezine.daemonnews.org/200301/esa3.html">a review of O'Reilly's 3rd edition Essential System Administration</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="http://gemal.dk/mozilla/mozdev.html">Using Mozilla for development and debugging</a>, apart from anything this site has a neat CSS layout</li>
  <li>one of the weekly updates from the web reference list had an interview with <a href="http://www.sensible.com/">Steve Krug</a> (of "Don't make me think" fame) and <a href="http://louisrosenfeld.com/">Lou Rosenfeld</a> ("Information Architecture for the world wide web"), in which they were discussing User Experience (or UX [why oh why do they have to turn everything into acronyms??]). It's just an informal chat about User Experience and their tour of seminars. <a href="http://webreference.com/new/030410.html">Have a read here</a>.</li>
  <li>As a result of this article I had a look at Lou's web site and found <a href="http://connection.ischool.washington.edu/cmslab/">this link</a>, which is a site dedicated to CMS', their evaluation and show casing them.</li>
  <li><a href="http://crocolyle.blogspot.com/">A neat blog on IA, usability and UX</a>. Interestingly the analysis of UX available here not only relates to web sites, but also to the real world.</li>
  <li>Not web related in any way, but something I need to bear in mind when I move back. <a href=" http://www.freeview.co.uk/">Freeview</a> is Digital TV provider that uses your old bog standard aerial to transmit digital broadcasts. Once the adapter is installed you are up and running. Something I might just have to look into once I get back to sunny England.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030414.html">A review of a book "Paper Prototyping: Fast and Simple Techniques for Designing and Refining the User Interface" by Jakob Nielsen</a>. The bottom line, it's better to capture early on in the process any design and usability flaws than once code has been written. "Ten times the impact if you discover a needed design change early, and 100 times cheaper to make the change. The experience from both fields is clear: early is much better than late." Speaks for itself really...</li>
  <li><a href="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/aw_shneiderma_dtui_4/chapter1.pdf">Here</a> and <a href="http://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/aw_shneiderma_dtui_4/chapter2.pdf">here</a> are two sample chapters from the forthcoming fourth Edition of Designing the user Interface</li>
  <li>Macromedia now has <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/topics/usability.html">a usability topic centre go check it out</a>.</li>
  <li>Still on Macromedia's site, following on from the previous beta reports here is <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/special/progress_report/beta3/">Beta 3</a> and <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/special/progress_report/beta4.html">Beta 4</a> reports as well as a set of "under the hood" articles: <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/special/under_the_hood/report1/">report 1</a> and <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/special/under_the_hood/report2/">report 2</a>. Report 1 looks at the CF MX side of things, where the second report delves into Flash.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2002/02/22/udftips.html">More UDF info courtesy of O'Reilly</a>. Incidently I found this link on <a href="http://www.cfhub.com/">cfhub.com</a>, which has some great resources.</li>
  <li>And this is a fantastic example of a CSS and xHTML compliant web site: <a href="http://www.cingular.com/">Cingular</a>. The navigation is a bullet list and the drop downs are translucent... Very nice. While you are at it <a href="http://www.mediadiva.net/mt/">check out the developers web site</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://placenamehere.com/pnhtoolbar/">A fantastic free developer tool bar</a> for web developers who use Mozilla: </li>
  <li>After having taken a close look at the "Cingular" web site and took a moment to look at the site of the UE person working on the project and they had the following link to "<a href="http://www.webstyleguide.com/index.html?/papers/gui2.html">WEB STYLE GUIDE, 2nd edition</a>". This is an awesome source of information. I only looked through the page design chapter and found some great information on page structure, dimensions, length and consistency. <a href="http://www.patricklynch.net/">Here is a link to the author's site</a></li>
