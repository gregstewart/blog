A new project is looming large and it's another UI rework, giving me the perfect excuse to look into a framework for CSS that I read about a while back. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/">BluePrint</a> is a grid based CSS framework.

Initially I wasn't too sure how you would translate grids to web pages, but <a href="http://subtraction.com/archives/2007/0318_oh_yeeaahh.php">this blog post</a> and presentation, certainly helped in letting the penny drop. The presentation goes into a lot of depth about grid based design and takes you through calculating your grid to applying a design.

There's also a healthy discussion going on around the web about the pros and cons of the framework which has the <a title="The myth of content and presentation separation" href="http://www2.jeffcroft.com/blog/2007/aug/09/myth-content-and-presentation-separation/">Standardista's up in arms</a>, but gets a lot of backing from folks who just want to get the job done.

My initial impression is very favourable. For those who want to read more here's a bunch of additional links:
