It's been some time since I announced that I was going to write a book on JavaScript and testing,
but I do have a small-ish update to share. I have finished drafting the first section of the book, which covers
getting up and running with continuous delivery. It's very wrinkly and very much a stream of thoughts, so apologies
for typos, omissions and bad grammar. However I would still like to encourage feedback! So if there's anything you want
to let me know about feel free to leave a comment or open up a [Github issue](https://github.com/gregstewart/book/issues).

I have been experimenting both with [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.io/) and [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/)
to help with bringing this to the masses. You can view the [Gitbook version here](https://www.gitbook.io/book/gregstewart/modern-web-app-development/)
and the [LeanPub one here](https://leanpub.com/building-a-web-app-guided-by-tests). I'd be interested in hearing feedback
about the two versions and which one you prefer. I really like the web version that [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.io/) offer,
however I much prefer [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/)'s e-reader generated format.

I have also created a [basic page](http://gregs.tcias.co.uk/building-a-web-app-guided-by-tests/) with links to the publishers,
a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Building-a-Web-App-Guided-By-Tests/1513275702220730) and other bits and bobs.

That's it, time to get back to some more writing!
