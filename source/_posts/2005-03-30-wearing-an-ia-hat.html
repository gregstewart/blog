I have just found myself in the position where I have to wear an IA hat for a couple of days and it's one that I haven't worn in many years. But in the recesses of my brain I remembered there were a whole bunch of Visio stencils out there that could really help put your thoughts to paper (so to speak). Since I never blogged about them before here goes:
<ol>
	<li>Jesse James Garrett's "<a href="http://www.jjg.net/ia/visvocab/" title="A visual vocabulary for describing information architecture and interaction design">A visual vocabulary for describing information architecture and interaction design</a>".</li>
	<li>Michael Angeles' <a href="http://urlgreyhot.com/resources/visio_wireframe_stencil.php" title="Visio Wireframe Stencil">Visio Wireframe Stencil</a></li>
	<li>From the <a title="Information Architecture for Designers: Structuring Websites for Business Success">Information Architecture for Designers: Structuring Websites for Business Success</a> book, another <a href="http://iabook.com/template.htm" title="Information Architecture Deliverables">set of stencils</a> for wireframes and an isometric site map.</li>
	<li>Nick Finck provides another set of <a href="http://www.nickfinck.com/stencils.html" title="Visio Stencils for Information Architects">wireframe, sitemap and process flow stencils</a></li>
	<li>this set of stencils is extremely useful for <a href="http://www.guuui.com/issues/02_03_02.php" title="Visio - the interaction designer's nail gun">user interface prototyping</a>.</li>
</ol>
Also if you want more information on using Visio for IA work I can seriously recommend reading up on Dan Brown's series of articles on <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/archives/opening_pandoras_box_special_deliverable_1.php" title="Special Deliverable">Special Deliverable</a> (Boxes and Arrows in general is a pretty useful resource for all things IA as is <a href="http://iainstitute.org/" title="The Information Architecture Institute">The Information Architecture Institute</a>).
