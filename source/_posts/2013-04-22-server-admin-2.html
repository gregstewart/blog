<p>Just a quick note. I patched the server and also fine tuned the gzip-ing of the files based of <a href="http://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-save-traffic-with-nginxs-httpgzipmodule-debian-squeeze">this blog post</a>. Earlier this week I increased the swap file to a 1 Gig after two upgrades from Linode (Ram and CPU), which required a bunch of restarts.</p>
