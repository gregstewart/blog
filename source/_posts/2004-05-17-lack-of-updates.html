<p>Just a quick note to apologies about the lack of updates. I have been real busy setting up my own servers (web, mail, database and DNS) over the last month and then moving all the sites across and as a result you can expect to see a few posts on the setting up and configuring these services over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>I took the opportunity to move this blog over to a little page creation framework that I have been working on in <acronym title="PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</acronym> and <acronym title="ColdFusion">CF</acronym> and so far am quite pleased with it, though it seems to run a little slow on this site. There are also a few small bugs, so bear with me on that front as well. Yep everything is a work in progress!! :)</p>
<p>Additionally I have also accepted a new role, so it truly has been all change over the last month! And all for the better!</p>
