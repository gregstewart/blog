<p>Since this is one area of design that compete baffles me, I am always grateful when people care to share their knowledge and expertise and more so when they do it in a novel way. Stumbled across this informative <a href="http://www.mariaclaudiacortes.com/colors/Colors.html" title="Colors in motion">link on colour theory</a>, while looking at the equally interesting <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/comments.php?id=208_0_2_10_C" title="Designing a CSS based template - part I">series of tutorials</a> by Veerle. The former provides a very playful approach to colours and what they represent. The latter coves some design techniques and approaches to building a CSS based template.</p>
