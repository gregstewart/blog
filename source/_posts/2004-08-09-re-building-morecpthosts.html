A handy way to reload your <a href="http://www.qmail.org/" title="qmail: Second most popular MTA on the Internet">Qmail</a> control/morercpthosts is to use the "/var/qmail/bin/<a href="http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man8/qmail-newmrh.8.html" title="Linux Man page for qmail-newmrh">qmail-newmrh</a>" command. This command re-builds morercpthosts.cdb file without needing to re-cycle Qmail and hence stop your mail delivery service.
