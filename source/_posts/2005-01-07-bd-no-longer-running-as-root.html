A while back I blogged about instructions for changing the default user for BD, which is root, and finally got round to giving it a go. The links previously posted held all the information I needed, but since they were pretty elaborate, here in condensed form is what I did:

[code]
ugg:/home/gvs# useradd -d "/usr/local/NewAtlanta/BlueDragon_Server_62/" -c "BlueDragon CFML Server" -s /bin/sh -m bdragon
ugg:/home/gvs# passwd -l bdragon
ugg:/home/gvs# addgroup bdragon
ugg:/home/gvs# chown -R bdragon:bdragon /usr/local/NewAtlanta/
ugg:/home/gvs# su bdragon
ugg:/home/gvs$ /usr/local/NewAtlanta/BlueDragon_Server_62/bin/StartBlueDragon.sh
[/code]

And that should do the trick.
