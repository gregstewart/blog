Quite a bit of a discussion about databases on CF-talk today and MySQL got a little bit of flack as a consideration for Enterprise, mission critical and data sensitive applications. A few people were actually very knowledgeable on the topic and provided a list and links to resources about things that you should know about when considering MySQL as an option.

Jochem Dietem provided <a href="http://sql-info.de/mysql/gotchas.html" title="MySQL gotchas">a link to a good resource</a> and Micha Chopman <a href="http://www.houseoffusion.com/cf_lists/index.cfm/method=message&amp;messageid=176879&amp;forumid=4" title="Access alternatives (WAS: Security gurus out there?)">expanded on this </a>.
