A while back <a title="Embedded image" href="http://gregs.tcias.co.uk/2007/03/13/embedded-image/">I posted</a> about using the <em>data:image/jpeg;base64</em> to directly embed the image in to the source attribute of an image tag, however this did not work with IE. Today <a title="jsimgs: embedded images in web pages - php encoder" href="http://ddzoom.net/jsimages/out.htm">I stumbled across</a> this JavasScript solution. Certainly an option, though in my case it was overkill, however I thought others might find it useful.
