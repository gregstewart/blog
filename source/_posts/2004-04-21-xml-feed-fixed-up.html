<p>So I finally got round to updating my rdf feed. Originally it used to be
controlled by the CMS using a priority listing based on selection. But this
turned out to be time consuming to manage, and so I opted to simply rely on
pulling out the latest 20 items.</p>

<p>I also changed the way it was generated. Originally it used to down by
writing to a file. Again this seemed just too much and by simply outputting
the content to a PHP template and using the following line preceding the
output: <em>header("Content-type: text/xml");</em>, it works just as well
and always serves fresh content.</p>
