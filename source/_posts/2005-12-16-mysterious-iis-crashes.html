We recently started experiencing a few site crashes but there were no obvious errors, but after some investigating one of my colleagues (nicknamed the Wolf) stumbled across this error message:

[code]DCOM got error "Overlapped I/O operation is in progress. " and was unable to logon .\IWAM_BOB in order to run the server:
{3D14228D-FBE1-11D0-995D-00C04FD919C1}[/code]

He dug a little further and found <a href="http://www.codecomments.com/ASP/message334521.html" title="DCom got error Overlapped I/O operation is in progress.....">the solution to the problem</a> (look for the post by yakhunter). For posterity here is <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;297989" title="PRB: Configured Identity Is Incorrect for IWAM Account">the resolution</a>.
