Courtesy of Slashdot a reminder that you should also worry about <a title="Malicious Code Injection: It's Not Just for SQL Anymore" href="http://www.site-reference.com/articles/Website-Development/Malicious-Code-Injection-It-s-Not-Just-for-SQL-Anymore.html">other types of injection attacks</a>. Don't you just wish that everybody would play nice?

UPDATE
