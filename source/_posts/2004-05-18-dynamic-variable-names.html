<p>I always thought you needed to use evaluate to build up dynamic variables, but nope that is not required you can simply do this:</p>
<p><em>&lt;cfset "#arguments.str#.#key#" =  variables.holder["#key#"]&gt;</em></p>
<p>And even better it saves a few CPU cycles and dispenses with the <strong>evaluate</strong> function.</p>
