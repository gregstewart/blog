Just wanted to let folks know, and with trepidation, that the 0.1 release of Stubbie is available for download from <a title="Stubbie project page" href="http://stubbie.riaforge.org/">the project page</a>. I have also added a few blog posts to the project:
<ul>
	<li><a title="Basic install instructions" href="http://stubbie.riaforge.org/blog/index.cfm/2007/5/3/Installing-and-using-Stubbie">Basic install instructions</a></li>
	<li><a title="Download Stubbie" href="http://stubbie.riaforge.org/blog/index.cfm/2007/5/3/Download-Stubbie">Links for feedback, issues and suggestions</a></li>
</ul>
