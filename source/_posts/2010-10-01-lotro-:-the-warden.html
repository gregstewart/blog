I haven't been playing much WoW recently, since the LoTRO has gone free to play I decided to go and take a peak and rolled a Warden on Gladden.

In LoTRO there are two types of tanks:
<ul>
	<li>Guardian, traditional tank</li>
	<li>Warden, AoE (Area Of Effect) threat tank relying on gambits</li>
</ul>
Gambits are basically finishers for combos, i.e. execute a sequence of attacks in order to unlock other abilities. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambit">Wikipedia defines Gambit</a> as a chess move opener, where one sacrifices a piece in order to gain an advantage. "The broader sense of "opening move meant to gain advantage" was first recorded in English in 1855."

The gambit approach makes for an initially unusual style of play. It's been a while since I have played any games that rely on combos like that. You might think this sounds a little like playing a rogue in WoW, but I don't think so. Instead of building up combo points to unleash a finisher, different sequences of combo point builders result in different finishers.

These builders are known as Gambit builders and come in three flavours:

SP or quick thrust - places a spear in the gambit window
SH or shield bash - places a shield in the gambit window
FI or wardens taunt - places a fist in the gambit window

As you level up different combinations of those builders unlock a specific Gambit. How many builders to do you need? It can be as little as 2, increasing to 5 at higher levels.

As a result of the gambit builder approach, a warden's threat build up is slower, which is in contrast to a Guardian's which is instant. It relies on a mixture of damage over time (dots) and heal over time (hots) effects. There are also threat over time effects, but from reading they appear to be light threat effects and no where near as potent as the other over time effects, at later levels the HoTs in particular are the dominant AoE threat abilities, since they heal the whole group.

The warden class only has one single target direct taunt ability - 5 gambit builders required

Of note as well, Warden's don't wear heavy armor that is the domain of Guardians, and therefore rely on block and parry as well as their HoTs.
