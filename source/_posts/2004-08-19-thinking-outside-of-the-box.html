While reading through the Slashdot newsletter I stumbled on an entry about hacking the Linksys NSLU2, which was a two part article on <a href="http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Sections-article85.php" title="hacking the Linksys NSLU2 - Part 1">how to access a backdoor</a> on the network storage device and <a href="http://www.tomsnetworking.com/Sections-article86.php" title="hacking the Linksys NSLU2 - Part 2">modify it to support ssh, nfs and pretty much anything else you can think of</a> as it runs a Linux OS. A real interesting read and an insight into the approach taken to get around the security of this device. You can read up on even more information <a href="http://www.batbox.org/nslu2-linux.html" title="Linux on the NSLU2">here</a>.
