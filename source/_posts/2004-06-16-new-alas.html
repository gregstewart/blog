<p>I have only read the first of the three, but as it's nearing the end of the day I thought I'd put these up quickly. <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dynatext/" title="Dynamic Text Replacement">Dynamic Text Replacement</a> article shows how you can create fantastically styled headers using images, PHP and JavaScript. I know a few designers who will love this technique. I used to bang on about keeping images down to a minimum and thinking of accessibility. While the designers used to lament the fact designs were lacking all of a sudden due to the lack of type face support and rich imagery. Well now you can have the best of both...</p>
<p>The other two articles can be found <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/dynanav/" title="Dynamically Conjuring Drop-Down Navigation">here</a> and <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/negativemargins/" title="Creating Liquid Layouts with Negative Margins">here</a></p>
