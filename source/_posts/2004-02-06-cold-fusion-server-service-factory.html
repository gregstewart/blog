<p>A question arose on the CFDJ list about the debugging information that gets displayed, specifically the person asking the question wanted to know where this information comes from. Simon Horwith pointed it out the service factory is responsible for this information. Someone posted <a href="http://spike.oli.tudelft.nl/jochemd/index.cfm?PageID=10" title="cf.Factory">this link</a> which gives an overview of the service factory in CFMX and how it can be accessed. The author also has a few in-depth examples of how to access and put this information to good use.</p>
