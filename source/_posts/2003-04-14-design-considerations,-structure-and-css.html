<p>When putting together a  color scheme, note it down in the style sheet or oin the style guide for future reference like such:</p>
<p><em>/*<br />
<br />
Base color scheme for Client X:<br />
<br />
Core blue: #xxxxxx<br />
<br />
Table header: #xxxxxx<br />
<br />
Table row: #xxxxxx<br />
<br />
Table row alternate: #xxxxxx<br />
<br />
Complementary orange link: #xxxxxx<br />
<br />
Faded orange (visited link): #xxxxxx<br />
<br />
Strong orange header: #xxxxxx<br />
<br />
*/</em></p>
<p>Who is your audience? Determine who it is to limit the design options and deliver a solution targeted at these so that they can reap the greatest benefit from visiting the site. In the same way it helps to know who isn't part of your audience</p>

<p>Content: Make this a priority. Always mention it in the project on-line as experience has shown that acquiring content form the client can be a slow and somtimes painful process.</p>

<p>importing external css files</p>

<p><em>@import url("real.css");<br />
<br />
/*<br />
funny how that needs the ; to work when it's alone<br />
*/<br />
<br />
/*<br />
the dodge through here prevents Flash Of Unstyled Content in ie6pc<br />
*/<br />
<br />
/*<br />
import with quotes and brackets hides css from:<br />
<br />
Netscape 4.x<br />
Win IE 3<br />
Win IE 4<br />
Mac IE 4.01<br />
Mac IE 4.5<br />
Konqueror 2.1.2<br />
Win Amaya 5.1<br />
<br />
