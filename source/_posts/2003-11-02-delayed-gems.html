<p>Seems like forever since I have posted up a set of links discovered/uncovered and digested. There's quite a few, so enjoy this months traves into <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym>, .htaccess, <acronym title="extensible Hyper Text Markup Language">xHTML</acronym>, mod_gzip and setting up your own business just to name a few.</p>
