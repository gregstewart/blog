<p>I-Lin Kuo, who regularly contributes to the CFDJ list on matters relating to databases has just had his <a href=" http://www.sys-con.com/coldfusion/article.cfm?id=711" title="Writing Queries for Oracle vs SQL Server - Utilize the database in CF apps">first article published</a> (hat tip Simon Horwith). This is a really good overview of the differences in coding for Oracle and MS SQL and in addition in answers many commonly encountered questions on the list and how they can be solved for either system and of course making the most of the database.</p>

<p>On another note I guess there is very little chance of getting away from having to re-write the queries but if you add DAO design pattern that I mentioned a few weeks back [the SUN website has a pretty good overview, with some samples, of how to apply the pattern in an environment that accommodates MS SQL and Oracle (http://java.sun.com/blueprints/patterns/DAO.html)]. So in addition to the above at least the maintenance/development of queries for differing platforms could be further lightened.</p>
