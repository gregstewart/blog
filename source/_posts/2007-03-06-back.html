After nearly three weeks of downtime, the site is back up. The move from my own little blogging tool to <a title="WordPress" href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> has been relatively painless... There was a small performance issue with 2.1 (which was rather drastic on my 64 meg VM), but the latest patch to 2.1.2 seems to have addressed this, as well as a <a title="WordPress 2.1.1 dangerous, Upgrade to 2.1.2" href="http://wordpress.org/development/2007/03/upgrade-212/">security exploit</a>.

One of the interesting side effects of this migration (well to me anyway), was the realisation that I have published 409 tidbits since October 2001.  Some of the writing is really quite amusing and in hindsight wrong. The spelling and grammar equally so... but hey you got to start somewhere.
