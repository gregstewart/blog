<a href="http://www.couloir.org/" title="(2004) Biking on Molas Pass - Mountain Photos at Couloir.org">Couloir</a> presents an image slide show with opaque/fade image loading, the coup, no Flash. And <a href="http://clagnut.com/sandbox/imagefades/" title="Onload image fades without Flash">Clagnut shows us how it's done</a>! Very neat! Hat tip to <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/1104b.shtml" title="Jeffrey Zeldman Presents The Daily Report">Zeldman</a>!

And while we are on the topic of CSS, why not have a look at <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/" title="QuircksMode.org">QuircksMode.org</a>, which has an awesome collection of CSS bugs, examples and workarounds (again with examples). Peter-Paul Koch has compiled over 150 pages of tips and tricks.
