Simply enabling Open Chrome on your phone → Settings → Developer Tools → check Enable USB Web debugging and running the following command:



<pre><code>adb forward tcp:9222 localabstract:chrome_devtools_remote
</code></pre>

are not quite enough to be able to bring up the Remote Webkit inspector. Remember to also check the box for Settings → Developer options → USB debugging and then you are good to go!
