I am getting closer and closer to completing my first Mach-ii application and I just thought I'd note down one other thing I figured out, namely how to check whether an argument exists or not. Initially I tried using <strong>StructKeyExists()</strong> function with no success. So I decided to just &lt;cfdump&gt; request.event to see what other methods where available (other than getArg()) and sure enough you can do a <strong>event.isArgDefined()</strong> to check for the existence of an argument.
