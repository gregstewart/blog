Charlie Arehart has a handy little article published in this months CFDJ on using <a title="Download Details: Log Parser 2.2" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=890cd06b-abf8-4c25-91b2-f8d975cf8c07&amp;displaylang=en">Microsoft's Log Parser tool</a>, which allows you to write SQL like statements against your CFMX log files. Couldn't find a publicly accessible link, but if you keep an eye on his <a title="Articles by Charlie Arehart" href="http://carehart.org/articles.cfm">articles page</a>, I am sure he'll update it as soon as it is available.
<h4>Update</h4>
Charlie dropped me a note last week to let me know that the article can be found <a title="Monitoring Your ColdFusion Environment With the Free Log Parser Toolkit" href="http://coldfusion.sys-con.com/read/296223.htm">on-line here</a>
