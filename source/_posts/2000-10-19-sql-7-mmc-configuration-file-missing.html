<p>Recently our SQL box crashed and after a reboot, all the services were working fine, apart from the Microsoft Management Console for SQL (Enterprise Manager). You could however still administrate the server remotely through the MMC on a workstation. The error message we got was that hte MMC file could not be found. On inspection it turned out that the file entitled <strong>SQL Server Enterprise Manager.MSC</strong> was gone. Why this happened I do not know and if anybody can shed some light on this I would be grateful. A search through Technet, did little to shed any more light on this. So what we did is copy a version of the aforementioned <strong>.MSC</strong> file that was residing on aforementioned NT workstation into <strong>&lt;drive letter&gt;:MSSQL7BINN</strong> on the server and that appears to have fixed the problem.</p>
