<p>A while back I played around with the idea of building a search facility for my site and as since it's driven by a database I used queries using the <em>LIKE '%%'</em> clause to return results. Since then however I have stumbled across full text searching. In the following I'll talk you through setting up your database to accept full text searches and then run a basic query to test it.</p>
<p>Since my table was already up and running I had to ALTER it to create a <strong>Full text</strong> index on the column I wanted to search against. So if you are in the same boat and are adding such a feature to an existing database, you will have to type something similar to the following:</p>
<p><em>ALTER TABLE `yourTable` ADD FULLTEXT `yourFullTextColumnName` (<br />
`yourTableColumnName`<br />
)</em></p>
<p>If you are creating your table form scratch, then you can add this to the CREATE table statement, like such:</p>
<p><em>CREATE TABLE yourTable (<br />
id INT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,<br />
yourTableColumnName body TEXT,<br />
FULLTEXT (yourTableColumnName)<br />
);</em></p>
<p>So far so good, so know let's test our set up. Executing a full text search will require you to require select statement, like the one shown below:</p>
<p><em>SELECT *<br />
FROM yourTable<br />
WHERE MATCH (<br />
yourFullTextColumnName<br />
)<br />
AGAINST (<br />
'keyword'<br />
)</em></p>
<p>The MATCH statement executes a natural language search for a given string (in this case 'keyword') against the column listed in the MATCH and returns a result set ranked by highest relevance but only if the statement appears in the where clause. The following statement gives you a chance to also generate a score for your result set. Please note that by using MATCH () AGAINST () statement in the WHERE clause we ensure that the result is ordered by relevance.</p>
<p><em>SELECT other columns,<br />
MATCH (yourFullTextColumnName) AGAINST ('keyword') AS score<br />
FROM yourTable<br />
WHERE MATCH (yourFullTextColumnName) AGAINST ('keyword')</em></p>
<p>So there you go, a rough guide to enabling and testing full text searching on MySQL.</p>
