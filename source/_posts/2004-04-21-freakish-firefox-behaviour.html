<p>I was trying access my locahost on a non-standard port and firefox kindly
re-directed me to <a href="http://localhost.be/" title="check out
localhost.be">localhost.be</a>. I turns out that having
<strong>keyword.enabled</strong> = true, in your
<strong>about:config</strong> results in you being re-directed there. The
fix can also <a
href="http://www.localhost.be/?dir=weblog&item=belogged-detail&id=25"
title="Hit it">be found</a> on that site. Thanks!</p>
