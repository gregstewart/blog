So you have deployed your app and can access the start page of your grails app. If you are like me deploying your app to a Debian\Jetty type of configuration you might come across the following error:

[code]java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/servlet/jsp/jstl/core/Config [/code]

When trying to access a controller from the default start page. I traced this to <a href="http://n4.nabble.com/Grails-1-2-0-JSTL-lib-from-war-td1355918.html#a1355918">a missing dependency in grails</a> (I use SpringSource Tool Suite for development so that maybe the root cause). By opening and editing your /project/grails-app/conf/(default package)/BuildConfig.groovy, add the following under grails.project.dependency.resolution. 

[code]grails.project.dependency.resolution = {
	...
	dependencies {
        // specify dependencies here under either 'build', 'compile', 'runtime', 'test' or 'provided' scopes eg.
	runtime "javax.servlet:jstl:1.1.2"
        // runtime 'mysql:mysql-connector-java:5.1.5'
	}
}[/code]

Build your war and re-deploy. Still getting an error?? I was. For jetty there was still an issue with calling the controller. After spending some time exploring, it looks like Jetty support was removed from Grails 1.2. I stumbled across a post mentioning installing the <a href="http://www.grails.org/plugin/jetty">grails Jetty plugin</a> with:

 [code]. grails install-plugin jetty[/code]

After running this, and re-building my war file and re-deploying it one final time, bingo it all worked.
