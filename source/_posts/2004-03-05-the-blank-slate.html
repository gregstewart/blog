<p>Signal 37 have brought up a common issue with delivering projects, that we all face, but probably have never identified as a real/tangible problem before. <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000375.php" title="The Challenge of Designing the &quot;Blank Slate&quot;">The Challenge of Designing the &quot;Blank Slate&quot;</a>, reflects on the delivery of a dynamic site to the customer with no content available, after all he will be populating it with content once he starts using it.</p>
<p>The solution that have adopted is populating the interface with context relevant information, which will gradually be replaced by the end users content. A nice idea... <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000578.php">And here</a> you can see the follow up with some sample screenshots.</p>
