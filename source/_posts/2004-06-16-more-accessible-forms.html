<p><a href="http://webstandards.org/learn/tutorials/accessible-forms/01-accessible-forms.html" title="Accessible HTML/XHTML Forms">Here is a real in depth look</a> at how to build accessible forms.

It's nicely split into three levels of complexity and really neatly guides you through all the caveats, while presenting good working solutions and explaining clearly why these are good.</p>
