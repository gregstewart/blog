<p>Stumbled across <a href="http://www.corecss.com/" title="CoreCss">this site</a>, thanks to a post on Slashdot. Yet another book on CSS further indicating the rising tide of CSS, but what I liked about this site (event if the CSS layout wasn't perfect in FireFox), was the compatibility charts and full CSS property lists.</p>
