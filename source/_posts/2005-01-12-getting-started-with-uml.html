Again another series of useful links and articles provided by some of our top <acronym title="ColdFusion Developers">cfers</acronym> out there. Dough Hughes has dipped his toes into the <acronym title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</acronym> and will be sharing his experiences. I for one look forward to reading his <acronym title="Unified Modeling Language">UML</acronym> digests. <a href="http://www.doughughes.net/index.cfm/page-blogLink/entryId-68" title="Learning UML">He kicks off the process</a> with his reasons for learning UML and what he intends to achieve and continues with an overview of <a href="http://www.doughughes.net/index.cfm/page-blogLink/entryId-71" title="What Is UML?">what UML is all about</a>.

Sean Corfield supplements these two posts with <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/769.html" title="UML basics: An introduction to the Unified Modeling Language">a couple</a> <a href="http://pigseye.kennesaw.edu/~dbraun/csis4650/A&amp;D/index.htm" title="Object Oriented Analysis and Design Team">of links</a> that he was made aware of by Jared Rypka-Hauer.
