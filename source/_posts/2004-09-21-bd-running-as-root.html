David Epler and Jim Dew have posted two solutions to changing the default user account that BD uses to run on a *nix system (namely root!!). You can read up on their solutions <a href="http://www.newatlanta.com/c/products/bluedragon/self_help/archiveSearch/detail?page=1&amp;messageId=74977" title="Final post and full thred">here</a>. New Atlanta and the people on the mailing list are truly an amazing bunch.
