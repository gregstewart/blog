In yesterday's post I commented on my lack of rage generation in some five mans. Combine that with a comment that someone made in another run about my spec being wrong (and while my current spec is not ideal, he was referring about me tanking as Fury - everybody is an expert these days). I thought I'd jot down a few notes on the topic.

As you hit level 10, you get to spend your first <a title="Wow wiki talent points" href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Talent_points">talent points</a>, that is you get to make a choice about the direction you want to take your character in. To be honest though, even if you are committed to tanking your way to 80, for you now you could safely ignore most of the tanking talents and purely focus on the <acronym title="Damage Per Second">DPS</acronym> ones. After all, the faster things die the quicker you'll get there.

I should point out that, and most of you probably know this already, things will change drastically in Cataclysm and you will be locked into the tree you spend your first point in (until you reach the bottom of the tree that is, then you can put some points in the other trees), for now though we still in a world where you can pick and mix.

<a><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-39" title="ScreenShot_090510_095323" src="http://tank-n-spank.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ScreenShot_090510_095323.jpeg" alt="Clearly @ lvl 19" width="1280" height="800" /></a>

So what spec should you focus on for the first ten levels? As always there's no one way, but personally I think that your first five points should go into <a title="Cruelty" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=12856">Cruelty</a>, followed by 5 points in <a title="Unbridled Wrath" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=13002">Unbridled Wrath</a>, so your tree would you look like this:

<a title="10-20 Warrior talent spec" href="http://www.wowhead.com/talent#LZ0xx">Wowhead 10-20 talent spec</a>

I know, I know, if you were to armory Clearly right now you'd see I have 2 points in <a title="Armored to the Teeth" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=61222">Armored to the Teeth</a>, I wasn't paying attention and just went for the fury components of a level 80 warrior. At level 80 when you have pretty big armor stats this is a great talent, however at level 19 with my current gear this results in 25.90 extra <a title="Wow Wiki - Attack Power" href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Attack_power">AP</a> (the formula looks like this: <code>(armor value/108)*2</code>, i.e.  (1399/108)*2), not exactly much to write home about. In contrast for <a title="WC" href="http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Aman'Thul&amp;cn=Wildecard">Wildecard</a>, who has 28115 armor that translates to ~ 780 AP (since WC is maxed out the formula looks like this <code>(armor value/108)*3</code>)]. For now best to max out  <a title="Unbridled Wrath" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=13002">Unbridled Wrath</a> -  and that also fixes any rages issues you might be experiencing, or at least addresses them. :)
