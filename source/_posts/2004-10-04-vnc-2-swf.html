Having set my dad up with <a href="http://www.ascotinlessables.com/" title="A Scot in Les Sables">a web site</a> and installed <acronym title="Moveable Type">MT</acronym> for him, it's been a slight source of frustration in showing my dad how to use MT. The source of frustration has not benn his inability to learn, but I have lacked the time to write something decent up for or to find the time to sit down with him and show him how to use MT (it's more fun to drink wine, chat and watch the footy with him).

So I thought that it would be neat if I was able to record my actions on screen! I tried Robo Demo, but it continuously failed to install properly, so it was back to square one and that's where it has stayed for the last couple of months. That was until I stumbled across <a href="http://www.rocketboots.com.au/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=574264FC-E081-51EF-A7C1937AE775C0B4" title="Screen Recording Directly to a Flash Movie">this post</a>, which pointed me to: <a href="http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/vnc2swf/" title="vnc2swf - screen recorder">VNC 2 SWF</a>. Taking advantage of the VNC protocol you can use this little app to record your <acronym title="Virtual Network Computing">VNC</acronym> session and save it as a SWF file. Could this be the answer I was looking for?
