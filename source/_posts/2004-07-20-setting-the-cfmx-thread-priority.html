<p>Now this is pretty cool. Again from the CF-talk list, Joe Bernard has shown how to access the CFMS thread Priority information and how to increase/decrease it. As almost per usual now, you need to dig into the Java layer:</p>
<p><em>&lt;cfscript&gt;<br />
thread = createObject("java", "java.lang.Thread");<br />
// get current thread priority<br />
currp = thread.getPriority();<br />
// what's the max<br />
maxp = thread.getThreadGroup().getMaxPriority();<br />
// set the priority<br />
thread.setPriority(3);<br />
newrrp = thread.getPriority();<br />
<br />
writeOutput("Current: " & currp & "&lt;br /&gt;");<br />
writeOutput("Max: " & maxp & "&lt;br /&gt;");<br />
writeOutput("New: " & newrrp & "&lt;br /&gt;");<br />
&lt;/cfscript&gt;</em></p>
