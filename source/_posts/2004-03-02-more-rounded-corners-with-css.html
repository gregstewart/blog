<p>I think a while back I posted this <acronym title=?A List Apart?>ALA</acronym> article on rounded corners for liquid <acronym title=?Cascading Style Sheets?>CSS</acronym> layouts, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/customcorners2/" title="CSS Design: Creating Custom Corners & Borders Part II">here</a> the author expands on his previous article showing you how to accommodate gradient backgrounds.</p>
<p>Incidentally ALA also has a few other articles up there worth checking out: <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssdropshadows/" title="CSS Drop Shadows">CSS drop shadows</a> and <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/designingforcontext/" title="Designing for Context with CSS">delivering context (media) sensitive content using CSS</a>, which takes the concept of different <acronym title=?Cascading Style Sheets?>CSS</acronym> types (eg: print, screen, etc...) to a new level.</p>
