Well the fanfare is over I have had to temporarily revert back to the PHP form of this site as BlueDragon was suffering from a few hick ups. Now I am not sure whether this is a Mach-ii, BlueDragon, my coding style, server configuration issue, but after a period of two or three hours the server would be become un-responsive and the process list listed an incredibly large number of BD threads. Normally the threads number 20 odd, but by the time the server stopped responding there were hundreds.

So I tried a few things like changing mod_servletexec.so to the EAPI version provided by NewAtlanta, but I experienced similar problems as discussed over <a href="http://www.newatlanta.com/c/products/bluedragon/self_help/archiveSearch/detail?messageId=76001" title="Re: [BlueDragon] Apache 1.3.31 on Linux Hangs with BlueDragon 6.1">here</a>, so in the end I reverted back to the current mod_servletexec.so and switched back to PHP while I figure out what is happening. Sorry about any disruptions, missing images and what not while I switched back.
