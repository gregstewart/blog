I have been updating a bunch of code recently to make use of the new features in <a href="http://prototypejs.org/">Prototype 1.6</a> and one of the great additions in this release was the introduction of <a href="http://prototypejs.org/api/ajax/request">Automatic JavaScript response evaluation</a>. This allowed me to improve on my session checking code without having to fuff around with the response information sent back to the client. The problem was with XHR requests: i.e. if the user initiated such a request when his session had expired, then usually the response would fail or worse just hang.

The snippet below shows my new session checking code.

[javascript]
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
function myAjaxCall() {
 	url = "index.cfm";
 	pars="?fuseaction.someFuseaction&par1=1&par2=2";
	new Ajax.Updater(\\'div_to_populate\\',
 		url, {
 		method: \\'post\\',
 		postBody: pars,
 		onLoading: function()
 		{
 			//code to run while making the request
 		},
 		onComplete : function(transport,json)
 		{
 			if(json && json[\\'session\\'])
 			{
 				setSessionExpired();
 			} else {
            			//Code to run when the request has completed
 		  }
 	   },
 	   onFailure: function ()
 	   {
 		  alert(\\'something went wrong\\');
 	   },
	   evalScripts:true
 	});
 }

function setSessionExpired()
{
 	alert(\\'Your session has timed out\\');
 	window.location=\\'http://<cfoutput>#cgi.HTTP_HOST#</cfoutput>/?fuseaction=home.home\\';
}
// --></script>[/javascript]

The trick is to intercept the call when you do your session checking at the back end. Let's say you have a fuseaction called login.login (see below and yes this is fusebox 3 :S) where you display the login form when a user is not logged in, this is where I inserted the check for an XHR request, by looking at the http headers sent along with the request. The key here is a new header attribute passed in with Prototype "X-Requested-With". If this attribute exists then I know it's an XHR request and I can create a custom JSON header with an error struct that holds a key called session with a value of timeout. All I then need to do is encode the struct as JSON and pass that encoded struct back to the browser.

[code]
<cfcase value="login">
		<!--- gvs 1Feb08 - handles XHR requests that session timeout --->
		<cfset attributes.request = GetHttpRequestData()/>
		<cfif StructKeyExists(attributes.request.headers,"X-Requested-With")>
			<cfsetting showdebugoutput="false">
			<cfparam name="attributes.jsonObj" default="#CreateObject('component','com.jehiah.json')#"/>
			<cfparam name="error" default="#StructNew()#"/>
			<cfset error['session']='timeout'/>
			<cfif StructKeyExists(attributes,"jsonObj")>
				<cfheader name="X-JSON" value="#trim(attributes.jsonObj.encode(error))#" /><cfabort>
			</cfif>
		</cfif>

        <cfif StructKeyExists(session,'login')>
            <cfset attributes.login = session.login/>
        <cfelse>
            <cfparam name="attributes.login" default=""/>
        </cfif>

		<cfscript>
			xfa.submitform='index.cfm?fuseaction=login.processlogin';
		</cfscript>
		<cfinclude template="#affiliate('dsp_login.cfm')#"/>
</cfcase>
[/code]

Now let's jump back to the JavaScript code and take a look at the onComplete function again:

[javascript]
onComplete : function(transport,json)
{
        if(json &amp;&amp; json['session'])
        {
                setSessionExpired();
        } else {
                //Code to run when the request has completed
        }
}
[/javascript]

If there's a JSON object and it has a key of session then I call my setSessionExpired function which redirects the users. Now the json session key only exists in these situations since the call normally just passes back the result of the call.
