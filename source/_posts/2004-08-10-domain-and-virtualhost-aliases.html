Learned two new things about apache today. The first was how to add a domain
alias to your virtual host configuration. Where you see a ServerName entry
just beneath it add:

[code]ServerName www.yourDomain.com
ServerAlias yourDomain.com[/code]

This example will allow http://yourDomain.com to resolve to that virtual host (www.yourDomain.com).

The other was how to add aliases for virtual hosts. This one is a no brainer really, simply add the same Alias directive you would to your httpd.conf for a global alias, but this time for the virtual host specific entry. For example:

[code]<virtualHost 111.22.33.55>
DocumentRoot /www/yourDomain
ServerName www.yourDomain.com
ServerAlias yourDomain.com
Alias someMapping/ /www/yourDomain/someFolderToMapTo
</virtualHost>[/code]
