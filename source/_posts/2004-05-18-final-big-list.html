<p>I guess this will be the final list, now that I have finally decided to take part in the publishing craze that is blogging. In future these will make their way into individual posts and hopefully with a little bit more personal insight as well.</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.webreference.com/programming/mozilla/" title="Rapid Application Development with Mozilla: Navigation. Pt. 1">A full chapter</a> from the PrenticevHall book: Rapid Application Development with Mozilla. This chapter talks you through developing a navigation system using XUL. The focus is XUL and it's associated tags used for navigation development, however it does contain some code samples to highlight the use of these tags as well.</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.webreference.com/programming/javascript/j_s/column5/" title="Web Code Fixes Required by Internet Explorer in Early 2004">A brief article</a> on what the impact of the changes to IE as a result of the lost patent case. It also provides a workaround using JavaScript and document.write to load anything that uses &lt;applet&gt;, &lt;embed&gt; or &lt;object&gt;.</li>
 <li>A blog maintained by a ColdFusion development company, contains a lot of <a href="http://www.webapper.net/index.cfm?fuseaction=fuseblog.mainpage" title="Webapper blog">their experiences in developing ColdFusion applications</a>.</li>
 <li>A <a href="http://www.holub.com/goodies/uml/index.html" title="Allen Holub's UML Quick Reference">quick reference</a> on UML diagrams.</li>
 <li>Hat tip Zeldman, <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/itss/support/Training/Online/webdesign/" title="Web Design References">an absolutely huge resource</a> of links to all sorts of web design related information [some 30,000 links]. I had a quick look through the PHP stuff and immediately learned something new from one of the links. Superb!!!</li>
 <li>This is the author behind the O'Reilly book: CFMX Developers Cookbook. It's <a href="http://www.petefreitag.com/" title="Pete Freitag's Homepage">his blog</a> and from just an initial scan I saw quite a few useful little scripts and information.</li>
 <li><a href="http://blog.daemon.com.au/" title="Daemon | serious web development">Another CF blog</a>, this time by a group of developers down in Elizabeth Bay, Sydney.</li>
 <li>This is Matt Liotta a name that comes up frequently in the ColdFusion developer community, real clever bloke, <a href="http://devilm.com/" title="Confessions of a Code Addict">check out his blog</a>.</li>
 <li>Central is a product from Macromedia that in short allows developers to develop desktop based Flash applications. This site is <a href="http://www.centralmx.com/" title="Central MX">a centralised blog on the technology</a>.</li>
 <li>A presentation on <a href="http://www.systemanage.com/presentations/cfmxHiddenGems.pdf" title="CFMX Hidden Gems [PDF file]">the hidden gems in CFMX</a>, the reason this is up here is the reference to cftry/cfcatch within cfscript <a href="http://buildcfcs.blogspot.com/2003_03_01_buildcfcs_archive.html#90939832" title="The Build CFCs tool">more info can be found here</a> and <a href="http://livedocs.macromedia.com/cfmxdocs/Developing_ColdFusion_MX_Applications_with_CFML/CFScript5.jsp#1118165" title="LiveDocs: Handling Exceptions">here</a>. But in itself it's a very useful presentation containing a raft of information on CFMX, links to resources, tips, tricks and articles.</li>
 <li>It's been a while since I have put up an ALA article, so here is one on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns/" title="Faux Columns">how to get one column that is shorter than another to stretch all the way to the end of the content</a>. Well it's a trick really... but it works real good!</li>
 <li>Well it never rains it pours. Here is another ALA article this one <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/elastic/" title="Elastic Design">talks about em</a>. I had started using em for specifying the font size, but ran into exactly the same problem that Patrick talks about in his article. The solution use percentages. He actually goes much further and talks about creating designs that are completely based on ems and not pixels.</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.corej2eepatterns.com" title="Core J2EE patterns">The website for the book on "Core J2EE patterns"</a>.</li>
 <li>More <a href="http://www.patternscentral.com/index.php" title="Pattern Central">patterns</a>, all things related to design patterms, forums, news and articles.</li>
 <li>The author Peter-Paul Koch <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/columns/keepitsimple/keepitsimple_2004-01.shtml" title="Keeping it simple">tackles JavaScript and accessibility</a>. He dissects current approaches into three views: plain view (xHTML), simple presentation view (xHTML+CSS) and the full view (xHTML+CSS+JavaScript), where this final view forms the behaviour layer. He then proceeds to look at a fourth view, the one that most commonly deals with accessibility mark-up (xHTML) and behaviour (JavaScript) and introduces ways to incorporate the two to make sites more accessible and usable.</li>
 <li>A site purely dedicated to discussions about <a href="http://www.phppatterns.com/" title="PHP Patterns">patterns for PHP</a>. Yet more concept introductions, discussions on design patterns, code examples and much much more.</li>
 <li><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/jrun/ts/documents/tn18206.htm" title="Configuring Individual JVM Settings for each JRun Server">This tech note</a> describes how you can configure each instance of a JRun server to have different settings (such as use a different XML parser).</li>
 <li>Brandon Purcell once again <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/coldfusion/articles/multi_instances.html" title="Installing and Configuring ColdFusion MX 6.1 Multiple Instances with IIS and Apache Virtual Hosts">talks us through</a> getting CFMX instances up and running, this time with attention to Apache and not just IIS.</li>
 <li>Ben Edwards brings us <a href="http://www.mach-ii.com/downloads/docs/Mach-II%20Request-Event-Exception%20Handling%20-%20CF%201.0.pdf" title="Mach-II Request, Event, and Exception Handling">more documentation</a> on the inner workings of Mach-II, explaining in this PDF how Requests, Events and Exceptions are handled/implemented by the framework. He also has <a href="http://www.mach-ii.com/downloads/docs/Beans%20in%20Mach-II.pdf" title="Beans, Beans, the Musical Fruit">published another article</a>, which gives us developers an insight into how beans work.</li>
 <li>You can never <a href="http://www.15seconds.com/issue/040115.htm" title="Database Performance Philosophy">read enough about Performance</a>, even if you have covered certain areas before, it's always good to have a look again and again. You can always learn something new from someone else's experience.</li>
 <li>I didn't know you could do this: <strong>&lt;div id="main" class="class1 class2"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</strong>, i.e. specify two classes in one go! If you go over to web optimisation <a href="http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/classes/" title="CSS: Group Common Styles into Shared Classes">you can read more about this technique</a>, which is yet another bandwidth saving technique.</li>
 <li>A two part article helping you figure out how to benchmark performance. The <a href="http://www.databasejournal.com/features/mssql/article.php/3298411" title="Benchmarking Performance of a Query - Part 1 Elapsed Time">first part</a> focuses on understanding elapsed time and highlights a couple techniques for measuring the execution time of your database code using the Query Analyser.</li>
 <li>A <a href="http://www.rewindlife.com/archives/000041.cfm" title="Unzip a file in CFMX with java.util.zip">useful UDF</a> from the guys over a Rewindlife that unzips a file using the java.util.zip, requires the use of CFMX 6.1</li>
 <li>This is a great way to <a href="http://www.rewindlife.com/archives/000023.cfm" title="Handling file uploads without CFFILE">incorporate CFFILE into</a>  cfscript by using both java.lang.String and the java.io.FileReader classes.</li>
 <li>Here's a cool way to <a href="http://www.rewindlife.com/archives/000135.cfm" title="Pass CFCATCH to a UDF expecting a structure">xdump the contents of cfcatch</a> to a UDF for use with &lt;cfdump&gt;</li>
 <li>A fully <a href="http://www.cfcomet.com/other/index.cfm?ArticleID=32381637-0922-41CA-BBE305C2D66A7025" title="ColdFusion &amp; Com">qualified list</a> of common COM errors</li>
 <li>A neat little article that shows how the <a href="http://www.benorama.com/coldfusion/patterns/part2.htm" title="THE MVC PATTERN APPLIED TO COLDFUSION MX">MVC pattern can used in conjunction with CFMX</a>. It's not quite Mach-ii, but it's more information on the topic and I guess shows that the CF community is getting more and more into developing web applications using methodologies. His site also has a link to a <a href="http://www.cf-europe.org/preso/bhediard/168409/index.html" title="look at the presentation">breeze presentation</a> on the subject</li>
 <li>An IBM paper on <a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-secure/" title="Web Services Security (WS-Security)">securing web services</a></li>
</ul>
