<p>Just as cameron has found out, I have noticed this for quite some time: ColdFusion debug output combined with CSS/xHTML sometimes finds itself overlapped by the actual page content and hence cannot be read. Unlike me, who just endured it, Cameron has come up with <a href="http://www.sumoc.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=entry&amp;entry=011AF661-5004-2066-B78D9413A412BBBE" title="Debug Output vs Design - Custom Debug Templates To The Rescue!">a work around</a>.</p>
