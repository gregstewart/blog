So while talking about low level tanking, I spoke a little about Rage generation and some of the abilities we have at our disposal.

I forgot to mention how you actually get <a title="Defensive Stance" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=71">Defensive Stance</a> , to be fair I had completely forgotten: it's through a quest you can pick up at level 10 (<a title="Horde quest" href="http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1505">Horde</a> | <a title="Alliance quest" href="http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=1638">Alliance</a> | <a title="And because they are special : Draenei" href="http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=9582">Draenei</a>). What does <a title="Defensive Stance" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=71">Defensive Stance</a> give you? Well apart from certain specific tanking abilities, ie. <a title="Sunder Armor" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=7386">Sunder Armor</a> and <a title="Taunt" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=355">Taunt</a>, it also affects some of your attributes. You take 10% less damage and your damage generates 5% more threat (at some stage we'll talk a little more about threat, but in a nutshell this is what makes mobs stick to you).

Once you hit level 16, you get access to one of the staples of tanking : <a title="Shield Block" href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=107">Shield Block</a> - it is considered so important because a blocked attack cannot not be a crit, so spam that button whenever it's off Cooldown (CD) - once again be aware that things are changing in Cataclysm, but for now we'll concentrate on what we know for sure.

You can read up some more info on <a title="Wowwiki entry on block" href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Block">Block</a>.
