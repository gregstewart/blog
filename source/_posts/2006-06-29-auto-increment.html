Since the MySQL Query Browser on my Mac refused to let me set a field as auto increment through the GUI, here's how you can using SQL change an existing column to use auto_increment:

[sql]
ALTER TABLE `aggregatedWeekly` CHANGE `Id` `Id` INT( 6 ) UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT
[/sql]
<h4>UPDATE</h4>
I have also recently found out that the following works just as well:

<code>[sql]ALTER TABLE `aggregatedWeekly` AUTO_INCREMENT=1[/sql]</code>
