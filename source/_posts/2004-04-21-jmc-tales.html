<p>The JRun management console is intended to be a handy on-line tool for
managing your JRun installation, however it has turned to be a nuisance on
more than one occasion.</p>

<p>For starters, and <a href="http://www.sys-con.com/story/?storyid=43994"
title="Using JRun Instances for CFMX Deployment">I mentioned this in my
article</a>, when ever I stopped an JRun instance using the <abbr title="JRun Management Console">JMC</abbr>, it would
pretty much immediately start up. Great if the server had choked, but when
it's my intention... not so good. The only solution was to stop (and then
subsequently start)  the instance from the command line. Or installing it as
a service, that worked too.</p>

<p>A couple of months back, <a
href="http://www.sys-con.com/story/?storyid=43997" title="Confronting JRun -
Who's Afraid of J2EE?">Benjamin Blackwell</a>, who also published an article
in that issue, came across another problem with the <abbr title="JRun Management Console">JMC</abbr>. He happened to try
and add Verity and <abbr title="Component Object Model">COM</abbr> support for JRun using the <abbr title="JRun Management Console">JMC</abbr>. Having added the
arguments to the <em>java.library.path</em>, he tried to restart the JRun
server to have the changes take effect. And that's when JRun failed spitting
out:</p>

<p><em>Unrecognized option: -server<br />
Could not create the Java Virtual Machine</em></p>

<p>I turns out that somehow the <abbr title="JRun Management Console">JMC</abbr> had added this to the <abbr title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</abbr> arguments:</p>

<p><em># Arguments to VM<br />
java.args=-Xmx512M
<strong>-server</strong> -Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=false</em></p>

<p>And there you go, another handy hint should run into a few issues with
JRun. Thanks to Simon and Benjamin for sharing the info.</p>
