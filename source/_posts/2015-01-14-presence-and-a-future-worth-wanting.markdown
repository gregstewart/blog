James Whittaker is pissed off, really pissed off. We are held hostage by our browwser and we should not stand for it.

That's how he opens his talk on his vision for the future. I stumbled across it again last week I came across thanks to [this post](http://news.microsoft.com/stories/people/james-whittaker.html), where he also goes over some tips for stage presence.

There are 5 (well really 4.5) bullet points of about stage presence worth keeping in mind:

1. Come out swinging
2. Attention span interlude
3. Know your shit
4. Make it epic
5. Be brief, be right, be gone

He gives regular sessions on campus about Stage presence and I was able to watch one of the recordings and thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend watching it, if you get the chance.

This post is not about stage presence though, but his view of the future.Reading that post reminded me that I saw James Whittaker give this talk in person in our office. And he certainly came out swinging and kept on swinging for the whole duration. Below is a link to this talk:

[![A Future Worth Wanting - James Whittaker, Microsoft](http://img.youtube.com/vi/U1sJNzEHny0/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1sJNzEHny0)

For the most part I enjoyed his talk about his vision of the future. The jist was that we shouldn't have to go to the web to the find the information we are after. We shouldn't need to context switch. Our tools should be context aware and fetch the information for us. His example centered around going to a concert with his daughter after having received an email from his daughter asking him to go to a concert. His tools, in this case Outlook, should be context aware and be smart enough to fetch maps/travel directions/suggestions for restaurants and book the tickets. He bemoans that the context switch out of whatever tool you are in and have to open a browser or an App to complete a task. He firmly believes that Microsoft was one of the few companies that was in a position to deliver on this proposition based on the tools and services they offer. These tools are 'Super apps'! Things like Outlook + 'Bing knows'

While I agree with the premise, I came away from the talk feeling another walled garden in the making. Rather than building open APIs and services it felt heavily slanted to being embedded in the Microsoft ecosystem. He goes to some length to counter this, by mentioning Twitter and Facebook as well and does talk tongue in cheek about 'this is branding' when referring to the XBox and Surface, I couldn't shake that feeling.

I believe that for companies (particularly Microsoft) in order to remain relevant they need to be more open and allow tools from all sources to build on these systems (simply and efficiently). Innovation seems to happen more frequently and rapidly outside of large bureaucratic companies and while they have the resources to deliver, they are slow to do so.

The web was built on openness and I find it quite tragic that more and more we are seeing tiered service provisioning, vendor lock in and data lock in. I am not that naive that I do not realise you have to make money.

I don't want to be locked into a world where I could only achieve this vision with my Windows Phone (or iPhone for that matter). Maybe I am the odd one out, at work I have a windows machine, my phone is an Android device, my home setup is a Mac+iPad. Building so called 'Super apps' for all platforms is a big ask. However all of these devices already have a 'Super App' in common: the browser! We have had it for decades! Yes it was a pain to build for all of the different versions and while there are still problems, the last 3 or so years have seen an incredible convergence in supported features and functionality.

While we might have afforded the browser an 'incredible' amount of power, I use it for almost anything, I don't mind using apps, my context switch happens when I need to leave the browser to use Outlook, I would argue that we need to invest more in making our 'web apps' better, turn them into 'Super apps' that leverage the 'Ueber App' so that I don't need to have Outlook or something else open to get what I need and it should run on any device and anywhere I am connected!
