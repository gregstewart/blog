<p>It's been a while since I last put together a list of links and sites I have uncovered/discovered/been led to, so this is a big one. A right old collection of resources and information. Dig it!</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.asp101.com/articles/matteo/google/default.asp" title="Cheating Google (and Spiders)">A little trickery</a> using server side scripting to determine the user agent and then dynamically displaying additional keyword info (a better way than using black on black text) if the user agent is a spider</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/index.html" title="">Google Information for Webmasters</a>, as the title indicates all webmasters need to know to get their site high up on Google's listings.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/robots.html" title="The Web Robots Pages">Information and resources</a> about the robot.txt file</li>
	<li>A quite hilarious <a href="http://www.newswriting.com/groaners.htm" title="The 100 Worst Groaners">list of words</a> not to use in web writing...</li>
	 <li>Found a <a href="http://modulo26.net/daily/080703.php" title="Multi-Part Forms">useful article</a> which makes use of show/hide JavaScript to keep forms that are extremely long short. Enhances the experience by segmenting the questions and not submitting until all fields are completed. Also has a few externals on advice how to build good web forms.</li>
	 <li>The last post included a link to Doug Bowmans explanation of an image replacement technique. Sadly Screen readers such as Jaws had issues with this technique and hence made the solution no good due to accessibility issues. Now <a href="http://phark.typepad.com/phark/2003/08/accessible_imag.html" title="Accessible Image Replacement">here a solution is presented</a>, which makes the hidden text span shift off the visible area of the screen... funky text image, plus accessibility... well done.</li>

	 <li><a href="http://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/htaccess.shtml" title="Comprehensive guide to .htaccess">Comprehensive guide to .htaccess</a>, a really comprehensive guide to using your .htaccess file. Hot on the trot <a href="http://zlog.co.uk/archives/2003/08/clean_urls" title="clean URLS">this blog</a> talks about their conversion using rewrite  and a useful article on <a href="http://alistapart.com/stories/urls/index.html" title="URLS, URLS,URLS">ALA</a>. And finally here you can find a comprehensive "<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/pw/apache/rewriteguide/" title="A Users Guide to URL Rewriting with the Apache Webserver">cook book</a>" on the topic.</li>

	 <li>A neat little article from Eric Meyer on <a href="http://www.complexspiral.com/publications/containing-floats/" title="Containing Floats">containing floats</a>, i.e. how to stop floating items from superimposing over the next layer. Pretty cool.</li>
	 <li>Adaptive path have put a heap of their <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/events/training/construct/files.php" title=From Construct to Structure: Downloads"">workshop assets</a> for download. Very insightful.</li>
