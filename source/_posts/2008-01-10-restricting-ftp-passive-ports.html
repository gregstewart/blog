After a full day of messages going backwards and forwards between myself and our firewall admins, here's a <a title="Configuring Windows 2003 Firewall and IIS 6 for pasv ftp port range" href="http://clintm.esria.com/2006/11/20/configuring-windows-2003-firewall-and-iis-6-for-pasv-ftp-port-range/">gem of a post</a> with a script to restrict the port range used by passive FTP on Windows 2003 server (as well as telling Windows Firewall to leave those ports open). Who would have thought securing FTP would be so involved...
