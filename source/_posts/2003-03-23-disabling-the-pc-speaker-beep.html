<p>It's all fair enough for IS&amp;T policies and strategies to reduce the levels of distraction by not allowing PCs to play music, but I don't think there is anything quite as distracting as the pesky speaker beep.</p>

<p>So a quick search on the Internet revealed the solution to disabling that alert. Bring up your system properties (right-click on my computer), select the hardware tab and click the device manager button. Next you'll need to select the view menu option and select "Show hidden devices". Now look at the list of devices and locate Non-Plug and play drivers. Expand it and then right click on the one called "Beep", from the pop up menu select disable. All you need to do now is reboot your computer and no longer shall you have to cringe at the sound of the dreaded PC speaker beep.</p>
