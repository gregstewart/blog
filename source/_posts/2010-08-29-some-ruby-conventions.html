<strong>Variable names</strong>

Local variables, method paramaters and method names: start with a lower case letter and don't follow the camel case convention instead, eg. my_var, my_method_name(withMyParameter). Also method names can end in ?,! and =

Global variables start with a $, eg. $my_global_variable

Instance variables start with an @, eg. @instance_variable. Whereas previous variables "could" follow camel case convention, instance variables do not. So you would not see @instanceVariable.

Class variables start with a @@, eg. @@my_class_variable

With regards to @ and @@,  normally pretty much any character can follow @, with the exception of digits.

Class names, module names and constants should start with an upper case letter, eg. MySuperDuperClassName (I prefer constants to be all UPPER CASE)

<strong>Arrays and Hashes</strong>

Arrays are accessed by a numeric key (and use [...]), hashes support an object as accessor as well (and use {...}).

They grow dynamically. Array elements are more efficient, but hashes are more flexible. To access a hash index you still use [], eg. hash[key]

Accessing a hash by a missing key (or you can say indexed by a missing key) returns nil.
