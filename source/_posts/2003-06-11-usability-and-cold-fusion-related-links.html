<p>An article from jakob nielsen on doing a usability study on the cheap, then some stuff on setting a vitrualhost with the CFMX web server and heap of links about <acronym title="ColdFusion Components">CFCs</acronym>, then a few more usability articles on why it's important and how to design pages for people entering the site by not using the homepage.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Jakob Nielsen has put together an article on putting together a <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030602.html" title="Usability For $200">$200 usability study</a> for a client. The process follows the full blown approach, i.e. review the customer's needs, review the initial design according to usability guidelines, test the prototype (by making use of the <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20030414.html" title="Paper Prototyping: Getting User Data Before You Code (Book Review)">paper     based prototyping method</a>) and improve the search visibility. The approach does make a few assumptions, i.e. that the person conducting the study is a already a good usability professional. Secondly that he is aware of the principles (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/073571102X/teacupinastor-20/" title="Homepage Usability ">spelt out in his book</a>) and that you don't spend hours debating the results, i.e. trust your findings and roll with it. It all helps bring quality and cut the cost of development for the client.</li>
	<li>Time for some ColdFusion again. First <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/coldfusion/adv_development/config_builtin_webserver/config_builtin_webserver08.html" title="Adding a virtual web mapping">how to create a virtual mapping in CFMX for the built in web server</a>. (<acronym title="ColdFusion MX">CFMX</acronym>)</li>
	<li>Some good introductory articles to <acronym title="Cold Fusion Components">CFCs</acronym>, can be found <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/coldfusion/articles/intro_cfcs.html" title="Introduction to ColdFusion components">here</a>, <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/coldfusion/extreme/bforta_cfc.html" title="Using ColdFusion Components properly">here</a> and <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/coldfusion/articles/supsub.html" title="Using inheritance and composition in ColdFusion Components">here</a>.</li>
	<li>An interesting article on the principles behind <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/coldfusion/articles/oo_interface.html" title="building an OO User Interface in ColdFusion">building an OO User Interface in ColdFusion</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/coldfusion/articles/cfcmethodology.pdf" title="ColdFusion MX Components: A new methodology for building applications">At this location</a> you can find a PDF file on the new methodology of building ColdFusion applications: Components</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/blueprint/" title="PetMarket Blue Print application">And this link</a> shoots you off to a complete application Blue Print (a Pet store) using many of the Macromedia products.</li>
	<li>I found this article <a href="http://www.theusabilitycompany.com/news/newsletter/why_usability_matters.html" title="Why usability matters">on
	    why usability matters</a>, which looked at digital design on the whole and
	    also had related it back to <acronym title="Interactive TV">iTV</acronym>.
	    Interesting in that a lot of projects relating to web tv tend to attempt
	    to mirror a web site, when as the author points out the TV remote is nothing
	    like a mouse and hence web based navigation doesn't seem entirely appropriate</li>
	<li>I loved this quote: "<em>most visitors break a window and crawl in from
	    the backyard, putting a hole in the bathroom wall in the process</em> from <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/columns/ianythinggoes/ianythinggoes_2003-06.shtml" title="How did you get here?">an
	    article</a> about designing for users who didn't enter the site through
	    the homepage. Jeff Lash provides three steps to consider entry pages and
	    their design:
		  <ol>
			<li>Figure out which pages are accessed most from external sources (to improve
			  referral from external sources he points to <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/tutorials/tutorial_2002-07.shtml" title="Three Ways to Improve External Search Engine Usability">this
			  article</a>)</li>
			<li>Then optimise these new popular entry points and turn them into a mini
			  homepage. Describe the site and the functions that can be performed. Allow
			  for additional entry page specific related information. He points to <a href="http://user-experience.org/uefiles/navstress/" title="Navigation Stress Test">another
			  article</a> that can further help analysing your navigation in this context.
			  [The aforementioned article incidentally provides some great questions that
			  you can ask yourself about the navigation, well worth a read]</li>
			<li>Finally review your changes (and their impact on other sections) and keep on optimising.</li>
		</ol>
