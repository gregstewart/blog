I guess I could have continued on with my characters on <a href="http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=11135" title="Aman'Thul realm forums">Aman'Thul</a> and continued raiding with truly great (if somewhat rowdy) bunch of guys. There was also a European Guild (<a href="http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=273634&TabID=2296895" title="The European Treaty guild website">The European Treaty</a> - howdy folks) on AT that would have provided good raid times and several raid teams, but I wanted a fresh start, and having never played Horde that is the faction I wanted to play on. Oh and 30 ms latency... Hello! Certainly beats the ~200ms we used to have.

So after a quick chat with my wife the decision was made - time to reroll! With all the changes on it's way a part of me wanted to wait for Cataclysm to hit and view the world anew, then again, I had never levelled horde so I also wanted to experience that, before the big re-design. I also wanted to remind myself (how painful) levelling a warrior is... Meet <a href="http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Stormrage&cn=Clearly" title="Clearly the Tauren warrior">Clearly</a>!

<a href="//www.tcias.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ScreenShot_083010_155106.jpeg"><img src="//www.tcias.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ScreenShot_083010_155106.jpeg" alt="" title="ScreenShot_083010_155106" width="1280" height="800" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9" /></a>

Clearly (lvl 14) Tauren warrior. I had considered an Orc first and then save the Tauren for the Paladin class or Druid class later on, but I am sorry, they just look so bad ass and that deep booming voice and those horns... just won me over. I am levelling him as Fury for now, but will probably switch to protection around level 40 - talents permitting

Clearly has been busy running around creating a guild the last few days, so he hasn't been concentrating on levelling, but finally he got his ten signatures together and I am pleased to announce the formation of <<a href="http://eu.wowarmory.com/guild-info.xml?r=Stormrage&gn=Keep+calm+and+carry+on" title="Keep calm and carry on wow armory link">Keep calm and carry on</a>> on <a href="http://forums.wow-europe.com/board.html?sid=1&forumId=1145" title="Stormrage realm forums">Stormrage - EU</a>. If you are keen on joining, being part of the journey, and you stumble across this, just leave me an in game mail or post here with your toon name and I'll hook you up with an invite.

My other characters planned or otherwise are:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Stormrage&cn=Safetyoff" title="Safetyoff troll hunter">Safetyoff</a> (troll / hunter) at time of writing he's comfortably sitting at lvl 23. You might wander why I am including a hunter, well I am a big fan of the hunter class. Nothing beats this class in terms of skill, solo - play and versatility. That's right time for some Hunter tanking talk - well Ok pet tanking...</li>
	<li>Safely (Belf / Paladin) subject to change</li>
	<li>Treadsafely (tauren/troll / Druid)</li>
	<li>(Orc/Undead DK) </li>
</ul>

Enough for now - more to come :)
