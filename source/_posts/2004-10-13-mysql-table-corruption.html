A slight case of panic this morning, The table that provides the content for this site, somehow got corrupted. Thankfully a back up was on hand if the worst came to the worst, but before dropping, re-creating and re-populating I decided to see if there was an easier way to fix up the following error message:

[code]SQL desc `tableName` failed : Can't open file: 'tableName.MYD'. (errno: 145)[/code]

A little googling told me that the table was corrupt and as a result I should attempt to repair it. So I ssh'd in to my server and from the console logged into mysql:

[code]mysql -u dbUserName -p dbName;[/code]

Then simply ran the following instruction:

[code]repair table tableName;[/code]

And hey presto the table was fixed again and the site was up and running! Panic over!
