Just came across this neat trick that uses SQL to generate XML on the fly:

[code]
DECLARE @x xml
SET @x=(select geoAreaCode
, geoLevelCode
, geoLevelId
, geoAreaId
from tbl_geoLevel
where uuid =
for xml raw('geoArea'), root('geoAreas'), type)
SELECT @x AS geoAreaInfo
[/code]

The above will create an XML structure that has a root value of geoAreas and child elements of geoArea for each row found.
