<p>A whole new collection of interesting tid bits sampled from my Inbox and saved here for posterity:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Bob Allen told me I was nuts". First up the a look back at the heady days of the dot-com boom and the story of Netscape, from NewsFactor and can be seen here: <a href="http://www.NewsFactor.com/perl/story/20961.html">http://www.NewsFactor.com/perl/story/20961.html</a>. An amusing look at the way the internet was in during the it's early years and it's hayday during the boom. And weren't those days just fun, brimming over with unbridled enthusiasm...</li>

<li>The jewel in the crown this week belongs to RockStar Games for putting the original GTA up for free download. On ya guys!! Grab a copy here: <a href="http://63.236.94.8/rockstar/classics/index.php">http://63.236.94.8/rockstar/classics/index.php</a></li>

<li>in last weeks gem bag I pointed to a site that allowed you encrypt your mailto address in JavaScript. However <a href="http://dreamweaverfever.com/">Drew McLellan</a> (of <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/issues/154/">Flash Satay fame</a> (or you can <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/mx/dreamweaver/articles/flash_satay.html">see it here as well</a>) also had <a href="http://www.wbwip.com/wbw/emailencoder.html">this solution to offer</a>, though it does not look as solid as the one from my previous gem bag, as it make use of special HTML characters. I guess the point to take away from this discussion is, that just because bots can't do read the address now, does not mean they won't in the none to distant future. <!-- Incidently here's how one of my old work addresses would look like:<br />
<pre>&#103;&#114;&#101;&#103;&#115;&#064;&#116;&#101;&#097;&#099;&#117;&#112;
&#105;&#110;&#097;&#115;&#116;&#111;&#114;&#109;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</pre> --></li>

<li>speaking of special HTML characters, while reading through the related information above I stumbled across <a href="http://www.trans4mind.com/personal_development/HTMLGuide/specialCharacters2.htm">this link to list</a> of special HTML characters</li>

<li>this is an older message, but I remembered it today and thought I'd add it here. It's a bit long to read through, but <a href="http://www.k-1.com/Orwell/pol.htm">this essay of George Orwell's about Politics and the English Language</a> is well worth a read. It makes a strong case for keeping your English simple and straightforward, I don't think many politicians or indeed lawyers have read this essay for quite some time.</li>
