Finally managed to catch up on a few blog posts this week after another project deadline has passed and I came across two more projects that have started to generate unit tests for you:

<ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.numtopia.com/terry/blog/archives/2007/05/squidhead_and_cfunit.cfm" title="Squidhead and CFUnit">Squidhead and CFUnit</a></li>
 <li><a href-"http://www.briankotek.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/5/16/Stub-Generator-for-CFCs-Unit-Tests-and-More" title="Stub Generator for CFCs, Unit Tests, and More">Stub Generator for CFCs, Unit Tests, and More</a></li>
</ul>

Both projects do a hell of a lot more than just create test objects though. Definitely worth checking out.
