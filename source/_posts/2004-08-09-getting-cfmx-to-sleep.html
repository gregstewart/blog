I thought this was quite neat and thanks to Ryan Duckworth for posting it (admittedly quite a while back now). I simple way to get CFMX to sleep for a few cycles (well 5 minutes in this example):

[code]<cfset createObject('java',
'java.lang.Thread').sleep(300000) />[/code]

He also stated that it's no inefficient a process, because:

"A java thread (which ColdFusion code is converted to) is doing a NOP (no operation) procedure during a java Sleep command which causes no inefficiency.  The multi-processing nature of the CPU handles this functionality for you and will use those CPU cycles with other requests during the sleep."
