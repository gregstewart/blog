<p>Dean Edwards has released <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/IE7/" title="dean.edwards.name/IE7/">a patch for IE 6.0 and 5.5</a> that IE more compliant when it comes to dealing with CSS2. I haven't tested it but will be sure to [come of the feedback is very positive: http://annevankesteren.nl/archives/2004/03/internet-explorer-7]. The implementation is real simple as well, simply include the <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> file he has created first in your pages.</p>
