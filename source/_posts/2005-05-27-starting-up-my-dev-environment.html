I got a bit tired of starting apache, BlueDragon and Eclipse from the command line every morning so I wrote a quick and dirty bash script that I could leave running while I went off to grab a cup of coffee. Maybe someone else will find this useful as well (requires <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" title="Cygwin Home">cygwin</a>):

<code>[code]echo "Changing to usb flash drive"
cd /cygdrive/e/
echo "Starting apache"
./Apache\ Group/Apache2/bin/apache &amp;
sleep 5
echo "Starting BlueDragon"
./BlueDragon_Server_JX_62/bin/StartBlueDragon.bat &amp;
sleep 5
echo "Starting eclipse"
./eclipse/eclipse &amp;[/code]</code>
