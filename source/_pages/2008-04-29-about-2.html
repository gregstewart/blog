Welcome to my little corner of the web.

This used to be where I kept track of all those things that caused me much head scratching, but over the last couple of years writing about technology (ColdFusion and web development in particular) has become a little dull and add to the fact that most of the things that do cause me head scratching, have already been solved by others makes this site's original intention kind of redundant and rather than write posts about links, i have decided to change tack.

So starting today (08/03/2009) this site will once again be my corner of the web, where I capture things that I stumble across, find interesting and don't want to forget about, but more so my photos, ideas, thoughts and comments.

I appreciate that some folks that discovered this site via <a title="fullasagoog: Rich Internet Application Goodness" href="http://www.fullasagoog.com/">Full As A Goog</a> might not appreciate have random stuff show up in their Adobe aggregator of choice. So I have asked Geoff to remove the site from the aggregator.
